<p>Well, Boys and Girls! After Betsy’s adventures last year with the
Hungry Tiger and the Prince of Rash, I did think <i>everything exciting</i>
that could happen <i>had</i> happened in the Land of OZ. I rather expected
this year’s history would be a drowsy record of birthdays, visitings and
trips to undiscovered countries.</p>

<p>But scarcely had I begun on the first birthday, which happened to
be Cap’n Bill’s and which Dorothy had written me all about, when a
special radiogram arrived from the Emerald City. Ruggedo, the old
Gnome King, had escaped from Runaway Island. The Patchwork Girl
had disappeared from the Capital. You can imagine how anxiously I
waited for further news. Would Ruggedo succeed in capturing Oz?
Where was Scraps? How would the adventure end?</p>

<p>Well, even I did not guess the way it <i>did</i> end, and as you are probably
as curious as I was, I’ll only say that it’s the most unexpected and
mysterious happening yet! Really! There’s a treasure ship, a new
little boy from Philadelphia, a magic cloak and an Oztrich in it!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_1">CHAPTER 1<br>
Queen Cross Patch Flits</h2>


<p>Queen Cross Patch, the Sixth, stood at her
castle window staring crossly down at her cross-patch
country. From above it looked like a huge
patch-work quilt, spread over the rolling hills of the
Winkie Country in Oz. Each of her subjects had a
separate cotton-patch, and as each patch produced
a different color of cotton and each patch-worker
dressed himself and his family in the color of his
patch and painted his house the same color too, you
can imagine the odd appearance of the Kingdom itself.
The Quilties, as the people of Patch were pleased
to call themselves, did most of the patch-work in Oz
and, as the Kingdoms of Oz are nearly all old-fashioned
enough to use and appreciate patch-work
quilts, there was plenty of work to be done. Not
only did the industrious Quilties gather the small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
cotton-patches from their garden patches and stitch
them into gay quilts but they did mending and darning
as well.</p>

<p>For miles around people brought their old clothes
to Queen Cross Patch for repairs, so that Patch
was as busy and prosperous a little Kingdom as
you would find anywhere, but by no means a pleasant
one. Constant picking of the scraps in their garden
patches had made the Quilty men exceedingly
scrappy, and constant stitching upon the patch-work
quilts had made the Quilty ladies extremely cross
and crotchety. Indeed, everything about this little
country was cross and patchy. All the roads were
cross roads, and the houses as patched and shabby as
the clothes of the people who lived in them.</p>

<p>But perhaps, of all the Quilties, the Queen, herself,
was the crossest and patchiest. She even had a patch
over her eye. She had strained it from too much
fine sewing. Just now she was straining the other
one in an effort to see that all of her subjects were
hard at work. Finding that they were, she flounced
across the room and sat down at her sewing table.
Here, grumbling and scolding to herself, she began
sorting patches into separate piles, according to their
size and color. Except for her Majesty’s mumbles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and the occasional snores of a scissor bird, who
dozed on a perch by the window, there was not a
sound in the great chamber. But suddenly, with
a shrill scream, the Queen flung a handful of patches
into the air, toppled off her three-legged throne and
went entirely to pieces—extremely small pieces, too.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_017" style="max-width: 160.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_017.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Help!” shrieked the Scissor Bird, wakening with
a bounce. “Help! Help! The Queen has gone to
pieces!” At the Scissor Bird’s sharp outcries, the
Prime Piecer and Chief Scrapper of Patch fairly
rushed through the doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve been expecting this!” groaned the Prime
Piecer, and taking a huge bite from the chunk of
beeswax he held in one hand began to chew it
gloomily.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_018" style="max-width: 81.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_018.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Well, if you’ve been expecting it you’re not surprised,”
sniffed the Chief Scrapper crossly, “but
it’s too bad to have it happen at the busiest season
of the year. Now we’ll have to stop everything and
find a new ruler. Hold your bill, Nipper!”</p>

<p>Stamping his foot at the Scissor Bird, the Chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
Scrapper of Patch marched stiffly from the room.
Neither the Prime Piecer nor the Chief Scrapper
seemed to think it queer for the Queen to go to pieces.
And no doubt this is because, sooner or later, all of
the Quilties do this very thing. Living in a fairy
country and being magically constructed they cannot
die, so when they wear out, they simply go to
pieces. When a Quilty goes to pieces, his relatives
or friends sweep up the scraps and put them away
in a tidy scrap-bag and in ten years or so he comes
out of the bag as good as ever. This does seem a
curious custom, but curious or not, that is exactly
what happens, and while Scrapper went to fetch the
Royal scrap-bag and Piecer the Royal dust-pan, the
Scissor Bird flew out of the window to break the news
to the patchworking populace.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp54" id="i_020" style="max-width: 68.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_020.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>In a huge sewing circle, the Quilty Dames were
stitching upon a quilt and in their separate garden
patches, the Quilty men were busily picking cotton-patches.
But as the Scissor Bird flew screaming overhead
and they realized that Queen Cross Patch had
gone to pieces at last, they all stopped working and
looked fearfully at one another. Who would be the
next ruler of Patch? Whenever a ruler went to
pieces another was immediately chosen by the method
laid down in the Imperial Scrap Book and always
one of the Quilties had been chosen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_021" style="max-width: 93.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_021.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Now, curiously enough, no one wanted to be King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
or Queen, for the ruler of this cross little country
had to work six times as hard as anyone else and
consequently went to pieces six times faster. Therefore,
dropping their thimbles and scissors, the Quilties
started to run in every direction, pelting into
houses and down cellars, creeping into barrels and
hiding themselves behind trees,—so that when
Piecer and Scrapper issued from the palace not a
person was in sight. They had carefully swept up
Queen Cross Patch and hung her in a closet, and now,
grumbling a little—for choosing a new sovereign
was always a troublesome matter—they stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
sternly toward the cotton-wood to the left of the
palace. In this wood grew hundreds of spool cotton-trees—enough,
in fact, to furnish all the thread used
in the Kingdom. There were pink spool cotton-trees,
red spool cotton-trees, green spool cotton-trees,
orange spool cotton-trees, and every other color you
could imagine. In the center of the little cotton-wood
grew a somewhat taller tree, bearing always
one golden spool. It was to this tree that the Prime
Ministers of Patch hurried, for this golden spool
was the royal spool of succession, and when cut from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the tree led directly to the next ruler of the Kingdom.</p>

<p>Piecer had a large rag-bag over his shoulder, for
it was usually necessary to capture a ruler by force;
Scrapper had a pair of gold shears and now, standing
on tiptoe, he snipped the golden spool from the
golden branch and held it expectantly in his hand.
There was a regular speech written out in the Royal
Scrap Book, and as Scrapper had already chosen
three rulers, he knew it by heart.</p>

<p>“Unwind, Oh, Royal Spool of Succession,” commanded
the little Quilty importantly, “Unwind and
lead us to the Imperial Potentate of Patch!” As
he came to the word “patch,” Scrapper set the spool
on the ground and, keeping hold of the golden thread,
waited solemnly for something to happen. For a
moment the spool lay quietly where he had placed
it—then with a little bounce it began to unwind.
Letting the gold thread slip through his fingers,
Scrapper skipped nimbly after the spool, Piecer following
earnestly behind him. Up one cross road and
down another rolled the Royal Spool of Succession,
past the patched palace, past a dozen patched cottages,
on and on and on.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_024" style="max-width: 95.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_024.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>As it passed each cottage, the Quilties within would
give a roar of relief, for they knew that for the
present the danger of being King or Queen had
passed the members of their household. Sometimes
the golden spool would roll right into the front door
of a cottage and Scrapper and Piecer, thinking their
search over, would prepare to seize a sovereign but,
just as they did, the spool would whirl out the back
door and roll on merrily down the road. But never
before in the history of Patch had it gone so far nor
so fast, so that soon the fat Quilty ministers, panting
along after it, were completely out of breath and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
temper. Now the cotton-patches grew thinner and
thinner, the little cottages farther and farther apart,
and before they half realized it, the golden spool was
rolling briskly down a yellow brick highway and the
Kingdom of Patch lay far behind them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp54" id="i_025" style="max-width: 67.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_025.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Stop!” grunted Piecer, letting go Scrapper’s coat-tails<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
to which he up to this time had dutifully clung.
“Stop! I can go no farther.”</p>

<p>“Don’t leave me,” wailed poor Scrapper, rolling
his eyes backward in great distress. Neither of the
Quilties had been out of Patch before and the prospect
was truly terrifying. Now, whether the magic
spool heard the two conversing is hard to tell but,
quite suddenly, it stopped and sinking down by the
roadway, Piecer and Scrapper began to mop their
foreheads with their patched handkerchiefs and fan
themselves with their hats.</p>

<p>“Let’s go back,” quavered Piecer in a low voice.</p>

<p>“But we cannot go back without a ruler,” objected
Scrapper, who was the bolder of the two. “If we do
not find a ruler in four days you very well know that
Patch and all of the Quilties will go to pieces. Do
you want to go to pieces?” he asked severely.</p>

<p>“No!” said Piecer mournfully, “I don’t, but we’ll
go to pieces anyway, running on at this rate. Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
is wrong,” puffed the Prime Piecer dolefully.
“The spool never took us out of the Kingdom before.
It’s twisted, I tell you, and dear knows where it will
take us.”</p>

<p>“It will take us to the next ruler,” declared Scrapper,
who had recovered some of his breath and most
of his courage. “It is our duty to follow. Come!”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” sighed Piecer, rising to his feet
with a great groan, “but don’t blame me if it leads
us into a forest and we are torn to bits by bears.”</p>

<p>As Piecer finished this cheering speech the thread
in Scrapper’s hand gave a little pull. The golden
spool had started off again. This time, however, it
rolled along more slowly and, in spite of their uneasiness,
the two Quilties cast interested glances to
the right and left. It was all so different from their
own patched and shabby little Kingdom. Pleasant
yellow cottages and farms dotted the landscape, and
the fields and meadows, full of buttercups and daisies,
did not look a bit dangerous. On the hill a splendid
tin castle shone and glittered in the sun, and though
Scrapper and Piecer were quite unaware of it, this
was the residence of the Tin Woodman, who ruled
over The Land of the East.</p>

<p>Nowhere in Oz is there a more cheerful land than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the Country of the Winkies. But just as the two
travellers were beginning to enjoy themselves, the
spool turned sharply off the highway and plunged
down a steep hill. The first jerk flung Scrapper on
his face, and as Piecer had hold of his coat-tails he
lost his balance too, and over and over they rolled
to the bottom.</p>

<p>“Now for the next ruler!” gasped Scrapper.
Scrambling to his feet, and without pausing to brush
off the dust, he bounded after the spool. It was
fairly whistling ahead now, bouncing over rocks and
tree stumps, so that the two Patchy Statesmen, in
their endeavor to keep up with it, looked like a
couple of boys playing leap frog. When it did stop
Piecer was too giddy to see, but Scrapper gave a
loud roar of anger.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what it says,” shouted the little
Quilty angrily, “I refuse to take orders from a cow.
Is this our future sovereign?” he demanded indignantly.
The spool had stopped indeed, and under the
very horns of a cross brown cow.</p>

<p>“Moo!” bellowed the cow, lowering her head
threateningly.</p>

<p>“That’s just what we will do,” sniffed Scrapper,
“move on!” At Scrapper’s words, the Spool of Succession,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
as if it had been waiting for a signal, zipped
under the cow, dragging both ministers along, and
from the way it behaved in the next half hour, I
am convinced that some mighty bad magic had gone
into its making. It rushed furiously under fences,
over which the breathless Quilties were forced to
climb, ’round and ’round trees, till they were almost
too dizzy to stand, up hills and down hills, through
stickery bushes and over sharp stones. It even
dragged them head first into a muddy river.</p>

<p>“Let’s go home,” blubbered Piecer, shaking himself
like a big dog. Fortunately the Quilties could
swim, but swimming in quilted trousers and coats
was no fun at all and, dripping water and mud, the
two sovereign seekers felt more depressed than ever.</p>

<p>“It’s bewitched,” insisted Piecer, tugging at Scrapper’s
coat-tails. “Let’s go back!”</p>

<p>But Scrapper stubbornly shook his head and
trudged stubbornly after the mischievous Spool of
Succession. It was unwinding quite deliberately now,
but leading them deep into a dangerous looking forest.</p>

<p>“I wish Cross Patch had never gone to pieces,”
moaned Piecer dismally. “I don’t care who’s Imperial
Potentate. I wish someone else had my position.
I wish—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“There’s a sign,” interrupted Scrapper. “Look!
It says ‘Emerald City, thirty-five miles’.”</p>

<p>“Emerald City!” panted Piecer, forgetting his
weariness for a moment. “Why, that’s the capital of
Oz. Patches and pincushions! Why, I never expected
to see the Emerald City! Maybe our next
Queen’s in the capital, old fellow!”</p>

<p>“Well, then she ought to make a capital Queen,”
sighed Scrapper, leaning over to untwine a bramble
from his left shin, “but who wants to walk thirty-five
miles?”</p>

<p>As he straightened up, the gold spool whirled between
two tall trees and came to a complete standstill
on a short foot-path. A rustic railing ran along
the edge of the path and, taking hold of the railing,
Scrapper began looking anxiously around for the
future ruler of Patch.</p>

<p>“Do you see anything?” he queried, looking over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“No, but I feel something,” grunted Piecer, peering
anxiously down at his feet. “Beeswax and basting
threads!”</p>

<p>Next instant both Quilties leapt into the air. Then,
taking a firmer hold upon the railing and on each
other, they clung desperately together, for the foot-path,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
rising up on its hundred broad feet, was rushing
like the wind through the gloomy forest.</p>

<p>“Are—we—going—to—pieces?” shouted the
Prime Piecer, not daring to open his eyes.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_031" style="max-width: 69.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_031.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Cautiously Scrapper opened one eye and the first
thing that met his gaze was a neat notice tacked on
the rustic railing. It was only a blur, so fast were
they travelling, but opening the other eye he managed
to decipher it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This foot-path runs straight to the
Emerald City. Hold tight. No stamping or
kicking allowed.</p>

<p>“Private Property of the Wizard of Oz.”</p>
</div>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_032" style="max-width: 65.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_032.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Well, hurrah!” exclaimed Scrapper, thumping
his companion on the chest. “We’re not going to
pieces, we’re going to the Emerald City! Going!
Going! Why, here we are!”</p>

<p>And they were too. Right at the gates of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
loveliest city in Oz. The foot-path, having accomplished
its journey in less than a minute, now tilted
its passengers rudely off and, coiling up like a serpent,
went to sleep under a lime drop tree. Too
overcome to do anything but blink at the gleaming
spires and turrets of the capital, the two simple
Quilties stood stunned and still. But a business-like
tug from the gold thread brought them out of
their trance.</p>

<p>The Spool of Succession had slid off the path with
them and was now rolling gaily through the gates
of the city. Holding fast to one another, and scarcely
daring to breathe, the fat little ministers of Patch
went tiptoeing after the golden spool.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_2">CHAPTER 2<br>
The New Queen Of the Quilties</h2>


<p>The Emerald City, which Scrapper and Piecer
were now entering, is the capital of Oz and lies
in the exact center of that merry and magical Kingdom.
Oz, as many of you know, is a funny and fascinating
fairyland, oblong in shape and surrounded, for
protection, by a deadly desert of sand. There are
four large countries in Oz; the yellow Winkie Land
of the East, the purple Gillikin country of the North,
the blue Munchkin country of the West and the
red lands of the Quadlings in the South. Each of
these four countries is divided into many smaller
countries of which Patch is the seven hundred and
fifth, but all are subject to one ruler and governed
by laws laid down by the Queen of the realm.</p>

<p>The rulers of Oz always lived in the capital, not
only because it is so central and convenient, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
because it is the most beautiful and enchanting city
in the whole fairy world. Its cottages and castle
fairly twinkle with emeralds and these precious
stones, studding the walls and even the marble walks,
give the air a soft glow and shimmer, making gardens
greener, fountains more sparkling and everything
more glittering and gay.</p>

<p>Ozma, a little girl fairy, is the present ruler of
Oz and the wisest and gentlest sovereign the fairy
country has ever known. With her in the Emerald
City live fifty seven thousand, three hundred and
eighteen gay Ozites and nearly a hundred celebrities,
for Ozma has invited to her court the most interesting
characters from her four fairy kingdoms.</p>

<p>The Scarecrow, a lively fellow stuffed with straw,
is perhaps the most famous. He has a palace of
his own, but is a frequent visitor at the capital.
Then there is the Tin Woodman, who rules over the
Winkies and is a splendidly polished gentleman of
tin, and Sir Hokus of Pokes, a knight seven centuries
old, Jack Pumpkinhead, a singular person carved
from wood with a large pumpkin for a head, Tik
Tok, a machine man who winds up like a clock
and does everything but live, the famous Wizard
of Oz and so many more that twenty histories have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
already been written about their queer doings.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp69" id="i_037" style="max-width: 60.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_037.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>On this late afternoon, as the two bewildered
Quilties trod timidly down the streets of the capital,
Ozma was busily conferring with Princess Dorothy
about curtains. Dorothy is a little Kansas girl,
who was blown to Oz in a cyclone and later was
made a Princess and invited to live in the palace.
She is Ozma’s favorite adviser and not only helps her
rule over the turbulent tribes of Oz, but is consulted
about everything, even such small matters as new
ribbons for the palace pets or, as now, about castle
curtains. Choosing curtains is fun and there were
so many colors and fabrics, it took the two girls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
quite a long time to decide. They had about settled
on green taffeta, edged with gold fringe, when a
terrified cry came echoing in from the garden.</p>

<p>“What was that?” cried Dorothy, and dropping
a roll of taffeta, she rushed to the window. Ozma
followed quickly and, in some alarm, the two stared
down over the flowered slopes and green terraces.
But not a soul was in sight and after waiting for
another scream, they concluded that the first was
the shout of some mischievous boy and gaily returned
to their curtains. Had they looked five minutes
sooner, they would have been surprised indeed.
Five minutes before Scrapper and Piecer, toiling
breathlessly after the Spool of Succession, had run
straight into the palace garden. Darting here and
there, it had led them to a secluded grape arbor. On
a green bench under the arbor sat a most amazing
young lady, and as the two Quilties stared at her
in perfect astonishment and admiration the golden
spool stopped at her feet.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_039" style="max-width: 73.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_039.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>It was the Patchwork Girl, one of the very jolliest
of Ozma’s subjects. She had been made originally
by a wizard’s wife out of an old crazy quilt and neatly
stuffed with cotton. Her eyes were silver suspender
buttons, her tongue a piece of red velvet and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
hair a bunch of yarn that refused to stay down.
Margolotte, the wizard’s wife, had intended Scraps
for a servant, but when the wizard mixed up her
brains a double portion of fun and cleverness had
got in by mistake. When he brought her to life,
Scraps refused to work and ran off to the Emerald
City where she has lived ever since, making life
lively for everyone and having more fun herself
than a cageful of monkeys. Being constructed from
a crazy quilt makes her exceedingly reckless and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
gay and as more than half her conversation is in
verse, Scraps is a most amusing and delightful companion.
To the weary and already homesick Quilties
she seemed a vision of perfect loveliness.</p>

<p>“Superb!” gloated Piecer, throwing both arms
round Scrapper’s neck in his excitement.</p>

<p>“A beauty!” exulted Scrapper, returning Piecer’s
embrace with interest. Indeed, so delighted were
they at the appearance of their future sovereign that
they began to dance up and down and fairly hug one
another for joy. A sharp exclamation from the
Patchwork Girl made them stop.</p>

<p>“Ragmen apply at the rear!” cried Scraps, pointing
imperiously toward the back of the castle.</p>

<p>“Ragmen!” The Quilties exchanged indignant
glances. The spool had led them such a chase that
their clothes were torn and dusty and the bag over
Piecer’s shoulder added a convincing touch to the
picture. No wonder Scraps thought them ragmen.
Piecer was about to explain, but Scrapper, afraid
that this bewitching damsel might escape them,
rushed forward impetuously and seized her hand.</p>

<p>“Scat!” screamed the Patchwork Girl, snatching
it angrily away. “What do you take me for?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_041" style="max-width: 74.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_041.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Because we have to,” confided the Chief Scrapper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
mysteriously. “We take you for what you are, a
Queen. Three cheers for the Queen of the Quilties!”
wheezed Scrapper, signaling slyly to Piecer. And
while the Patchwork Girl fell back, stiff with astonishment,
Piecer clapped the bag over her head. Then
together the two little Quilties shook her down into
the bottom and pulled the string tight. It was the
frightened scream of Scraps, as she disappeared
into the rag bag that Dorothy and Ozma had heard,
but by the time they reached the window, she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
out of the garden. Thrusting a sharp stick through
the neck of the sack, the Ministers of Patch hoisted
it to their shoulders and, with the bag itself swinging
violently between them, started on a run for the
gates. They would never have succeeded in kidnapping
Scraps nor escaping unobserved had it not been
for the foot-path. After a short nap it had grown
curious about the two strangers it had brought to
the city and pattering into the royal garden began
to search for them. Usually the Wizard of Oz kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
this mischievous piece of property tied up when not
in use, but to-day he had forgotten to do so and, enjoying
its holiday, the little foot-path was running
perfectly wild. Coming upon Piecer and Scrapper as
they dashed headlong over flower beds and borders, it
scooped them neatly up and by a short, little known
route carried them straight out of the Emerald City.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_042" style="max-width: 94.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_042.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>For a time the Quilties were too shocked to realize
what had happened. Then Scrapper, shaken out
of his stupor by a terrible jolt as the foot-path
jumped over a boulder, gasped weakly. “Why, it’s
the same flying path that brought us to the capital!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but where is it flying now?” wailed Piecer,
tightening his hold upon the rag bag. Inside Scraps
was thrashing around in a frantic effort to escape,
her screams and threats somewhat muffled by the
collection of pieces already in the bag. “Can’t we
steer it?” panted the Prime Piecer wildly, “or stop
it or something?” Scrapper shook his head violently,
then catching sight of a green card tacked on the
rustic railing fairly pounced upon it.</p>

<p>“Write directions here,” advised the card. There
was a pencil attached to the railing by a long cord,
so Scrapper seized the pencil and wrote hastily,
“Take us to the Kingdom of Patch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>The foot-path jiggled so frightfully while he wrote
’tis a wonder it could understand the directions at
all, but as he let the pencil drop, it turned sharply
in its tracks and started racing in the opposite direction,
tripping and stumbling in its eagerness to
get ahead. By the time they reached the Quilty
Kingdom, the three travellers were so shaken up and
down they tumbled off the path in a perfect heap
of exhaustion. Even Scraps, in her imprisoning bag,
had nothing at all to say. Not satisfied with shaking
them nearly to bits, the foot-path gave Piecer a playful
kick with its forty-ninth foot and then, jumping
over a green cotton patch, gaily took its departure.
Now, ever since morning, the Patch-workers had been
anxiously awaiting the return of their ministers and,
as the two exhausted sovereign seekers rolled
through the gates, a great crowd of Quilties came
hurrying to meet them.</p>

<p>“What have you bagged? Who is our ruler? Show
us the Imperial Potentate,” they cried, clattering
their shears and shaking their sewing boxes. Seeing
that nothing would satisfy them but an immediate
sight of the Queen, Scrapper scrambled wearily to
his feet and began fumbling with the strings of the
bag.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“Will your Imperial Highness deign to step out?”
suggested Scrapper, sticking his head cautiously into
the bag.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_045" style="max-width: 123.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_045.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Out!” shrilled Scraps, and bouncing up like a
Jill in the box, gave Scrapper a resounding smack
on the ear.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You villain ragman</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Take me back</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How dare you hurl</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Me in a sack?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>she cried furiously and, whirling upon Piecer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
boxed his ears as soundly as she had boxed Scrapper’s.
At this the delight of the Quilties knew no
bounds. They began to cheer and stamp with approval.</p>

<p>“What a fine temper! What a marvelous beauty!
She’s the Queen for us.” And raising their shears
they shouted altogether, “Hurrah for the Queen of
the Quilties!”</p>

<p>“Try to act like a Queen, can’t you?” puffed Scrapper,
seizing the agitated Patchwork Girl by the arm.</p>

<p>“You’re making a great hit!” whispered Piecer
persuasively. “Give me your name, maiden, so I
can announce it to your subjects.” By this time
Scraps had recovered enough to look around and
what she saw interested her greatly. The gaudy
Quilty Kingdom, with its gay cotton patches, the
Quilties themselves, in their oddly patched clothes,
seemed as beautiful to Scraps as she seemed to them.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? Am I a Queen?” she demanded,
rolling her suspender button eyes from side
to side. The Prime Ministers of Patch nodded and,
as they did, two Quilties, with a huge patchwork arm
chair on wheels, pushed their way through the crowd.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_047" style="max-width: 56.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_047.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Quick, now, your name,” begged Piecer. When
Scraps, in an excited whisper, imparted the information,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
he cried in a loud voice: “Hats off to Her Patchesty!
Three cheers for Queen Scraps of Patch!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp54" id="i_048" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_048.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>The cheers were given with a will and, as Piecer
grandly handed the Patchwork Girl into the royal
rolling chair, the excited Quilties fairly pelted her
with patches, tomato pin-cushions and hard spools
of cotton. Luckily Scraps is a stuffed person, with
no feeling at all, otherwise she might have been
hurt by these flying missiles. As it was, she sat
back grandly, bowing now to the left, now to the right<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
and feeling more important than she had ever felt
in her whole cotton career. When they reached the
patched palace, two Quilty boys were waiting on the
steps, one with the coronet and the other with the
crown jewels and, amid the further cheers of the
populace, Scraps was crowned Queen of the Kingdom
and led triumphantly into her castle. The crown was
a round sewing basket, the crown jewels a string of
old spools, but scarcely noticing the odd character of
her royal regalia, Scraps strutted proudly up and
down the shabby hall of the palace, rehearsing
grand speeches and queenly gestures. As for Scrapper
and Piecer—too weary to bother about supper
or bed—they immediately locked all the windows
and doors and fell into a heavy slumber on a hall
bench.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_3">CHAPTER 3<br>
Duties Of the Quilty Queen</h2>


<p>Hungry from their long fast, for they had eaten
nothing the day before, and wearied by their
long quest, the two Quilty statesmen arose early next
morning. “High time to instruct her Highness in
the duties of her office,” yawned Scrapper, ruffling
up his hair.</p>

<p>“I hope she has breakfast ready,” muttered Piecer,
groaning a little as he straightened his knees and
stretched out his arms. “And I hope this Queen lasts
a long time, Scrapper, for another day like yesterday
would be the end of me. Come on, let’s see what
she’s doing.”</p>

<p>Not requiring any sleep, Scraps had spent the
first half of the night wondering how she had come
to be Queen. Then, giving it up, she spent the other
half dancing and singing and composing long speeches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
to deliver to her subjects. As Piecer and Scrapper
stepped into the main hall of the palace, she was
arranging her yarn hair before a long mirror.
Catching sight of them in the glass, she spun gaily
round and clapping her crown on sideways cried
haughtily:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Vassals, fetch my rolling chair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Your Queen desires to take the air!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Stuff and Nonsense!” sputtered Scrapper, amazed
at the Patchwork Girl’s audacious verse. “Don’t you
know the coronation is over and it’s time to get to
work?”</p>

<p>“Work?” shrilled Scraps, catching hold of a patched
portiere to steady herself. “Queens are not supposed
to work. Where are the servants?”</p>

<p>“There are no servants,” answered Scrapper calmly.
“The Queen does all the work here. Just read
off the list of her Majesty’s duties, Piecer, old fellow.”</p>

<p>Putting on his specs, Piecer drew a long sheet
of paper from his patched pocket and began: “The
Queen of Patch, on arising, shall prepare the breakfast
of her two chief advisers (meaning us),” explained
Piecer, looking severely at the Patchwork
Girl over his spectacles. “She shall make the beds,”
he continued complacently, his voice growing higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
with each item, “sweep the floors, dust the furniture,
scrub the steps, wash the windows, sort the patches,
count the cotton spools, separate the old clothes for
mending, feed the Scissor Bird, help pick tomato
pin-cushions, scold the Patch-workers—and—”</p>

<p>“Stop!” commanded Scraps, flinging up her arm
imperiously.</p>

<p>“But I’m not nearly finished,” objected Piecer, rattling
the paper impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, I am!” The Patchwork Girl’s suspender
buttons glittered angrily behind the steel spectacles.
“Get some one else to be your sovereign,” she cried.
“You don’t want a Queen, you want a cook, a housekeeper
and a Grandma!” Snatching the work basket
from her head, she dashed it to the floor and
jumping on it with both feet shouted defiantly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Eeejee, weejee, squeejee, squb!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will not sweep, I will not scrub!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will not scrub! I will not dust!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So let those dust and scrub who must!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Better save your strength for your work,” advised
Piecer, stepping back a few paces. “You’re
Chief Scrapper,” he whispered hurriedly to his companion.
“You settle her while I fetch the Scissor
Bird.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>As the door slammed upon Piecer, the Chief Scrapper
faced the Patchwork Girl. “Go on, get as mad
as you please,” he urged cheerfully. “The madder
you are the better we like you. The crosser you
grow the better queen you’ll make for Patch, our
Queens must be good scolders,” he chuckled, rubbing
his hands gleefully together.</p>

<p>“I’m not your queen,” screamed Scraps, stamping
one foot and then the other. “Take me back to
the Emerald City, you miserable ragamuffin. I am a
free subject of Ozma of Oz.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! You’re Queen of Patch, now,” corrected
Scrapper, picking up the waste basket and jamming
it down upon her cotton forehead. “You were chosen
by the royal Spool of Succession to be our ruler!”</p>

<p>While Scraps listened in amazement, he explained
how the former queen had gone to pieces and how
the golden spool had led them to the Emerald City.</p>

<p>“And you think, just because your silly spool tagged
me, that I’m going to stay and do all your
work?” exclaimed Scraps, snapping her cotton fingers
under Scrapper’s nose. “Kazupp-kazick, you
make me sick!” Rushing to the door, she jerked
it open, bumped against Piecer, on his way in, and
sat down with a thud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp54" id="i_055" style="max-width: 65.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_055.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>“What a pretty creature,” chirped the Scissor
Bird, who had flown over Piecer’s head. “Is this
the new Queen?”</p>

<p>Scrapper nodded.</p>

<p>“She knows almost as many cross words as the
last one,” he chuckled admiringly. “But she refuses
to work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think she’ll work now,” smiled Piecer. With
a significant wink at his companion, he thrust a
broom into Scraps’ hands and, turning to the Scissor
Bird, said quietly: “If her Majesty refuses to clean
the castle, just cut off her head!”</p>

<p>“Nothing would give me more pleasure,” chortled
the bird, and snapping his scissor bill hungrily, he
swooped down upon Scraps and snipped an inch off
her yarn hair.</p>

<p>“Help!” screamed the Patchwork Girl. “Help!
Help!” But there was no one to help her and, as
the Scissor Bird took another snip at her yarn, she
seized the broom and fell to sweeping for dear life.</p>

<p>“When you finish sweeping, you may wash the
windows,” said the Chief Scrapper and, taking the
arm of the Prime Piecer, passed pompously out
into the garden. All day, pursued relentlessly by the
Scissor Bird, Scraps flew from one task to another.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
Being made of cotton she did not grow tired, but as
she had never in her whole life done anything she
did not wish to do, you can imagine how furiously
angry she became.</p>

<p>“Wait till Ozma hears of this!” she raged, shaking
her scrubbing brush under the Scissor Bird’s bill.
“Just wait!”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait!” yawned the Scissor Bird, “but you’ll
have to wait too, and while we’re waiting suppose you
go on with the scrubbing.”</p>

<p>Poor Scraps, she could have wept with anger, but
she had not been constructed for crying and having
not a tear in her cotton constitution was forced to
express her indignation in groans, shouts and threatening
verses. To these the Scissor Bird paid no
attention whatsoever and by night-fall Scraps had
not even energy enough to make verses. After complaining
bitterly about their dinner, and it must be
confessed that Scraps, having had no experience,
proved a poor cook, the two Quiltie Ministers locked
her securely in the palace sitting-room and went off
to tell their fellow townsmen about the Emerald City.
They took the Scissor Bird with them and, left to her
own devices at last, the Patchwork Girl sank into a
broken chair and began to rock to and fro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“No wonder the Queens go to pieces so fast,”
groaned Scraps, anxiously examining a rip in her
cotton finger. She had caught it on a nail while
scrubbing the castle steps.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Kazupp Kazoo, what shall I do?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stay here and go to pieces, too? Never!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Springing up, she took the candle the Quilties had
placed on the center table and ran from one window
to the other. But the windows were all locked and
barred and, after rattling the door knobs and pounding
on the walls, she sat dejectedly down in the rocking
chair again. There was nothing in the room to
amuse her. All the books in the bookcase were
needle-books, all the cushions were pin-cushions and
the wall was simply covered with cross stitched
mottoes.</p>

<p>“A stitch in time saves nine!” sniffed Scraps, scornfully
reading the one nearest her. “Well, who wants
to save nine? Why should nine be saved any more
than six or seven?”</p>

<p>There was no one to argue it with, so after a little
silence she murmured: “I wonder what’s in that
chest?” Except for a few rickety chairs and the
sewing-table, the chest was the only other piece of
furniture in the room. Taking the candle, Scraps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
walked over to the chest, and dropping on her knees,
cautiously lifted the lid. At first she thought it was
empty, but, as three or four drops of hot candle
grease dripped inside, a low growl rumbled out of
the darkness. In some alarm Scraps jumped back.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp92" id="i_059" style="max-width: 100.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_059.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Go away!” roared a gruff voice. “Do your own
scolding, I’m sleepy! Shut that lid, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“Shut it yourself!” cried the Patchwork Girl, who
was extremely tired of being ordered about. Besides
she was a little frightened. At this, there was a short
pause, followed by a surprised grunt, and presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
a rumpled head appeared above the edge of the chest.
It was a small brown bear. Blinking at Scraps, it
grumbled crossly, “Where’s the Queen? Who in
scratch are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m the Queen, who in Patch are you?” answered
the Patchwork Girl saucily. The bear regarded her
attentively for some time before he answered. Then
putting his head on one side he explained calmly,
“Why, I’m a pet of the late Queen Cross Patch. Has
she gone to pieces?”</p>

<p>Scraps nodded. “I don’t see why she wanted a
bear for a pet,” she added frankly.</p>

<p>“You look bright, but I’m afraid you’re quite
dumb,” sniffed the bear, climbing out of the chest.
“Why shouldn’t she have a bear for a pet? Isn’t a
bear about the crossest pet one could find? I helped
Cross Patch with the grumbling and growling when
she was tired. I’ll help you if you wish, though it
will be a little harder. Just looking at you makes me
want to laugh.”</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you?” asked Scraps, seating herself
in the rocker again.</p>

<p>“Sh—hh! Do you want me to lose my position?”
breathed the little bear, looking around anxiously.
“I mustn’t laugh. Don’t you know a bear is supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
to be cross? You have to be pretty cross to
keep your place in this country!”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t intend to stay in this country,” announced
Scraps, rocking vigorously backward and
forward. “I was kidnapped and crowned Queen
against my will and I intend to run away as soon as
I can. Princess Ozma may send for me any minute,
too. All she has to do is to look in the Magic Picture.”
This was quite true, for in Ozma’s palace
hangs an enchanted picture, showing a country landscape.
If the little fairy ruler wishes to locate any
of her subjects, she has but to command them to
appear and the Magic Picture immediately shows
where they are and what they are doing. All of
this, and a bit about Ozma and the Emerald City,
Scraps explained to the cross little bear and he listened
most earnestly, wiggling his buttony nose with
interest.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” asked Scraps presently.</p>

<p>“Grumpy!” answered the bear gruffly. “What’s
yours?”</p>

<p>“Scraps!” said the Patchwork Girl, kicking her
heels against the rocker.</p>

<p>Now, one of the delightful things about Oz is that
all the animals and birds can talk; and as talk of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
kind interested Scraps she began to feel quite cheerful
and like herself.</p>

<p>“You mean Queen Scraps,” corrected the little
bear, eyeing the work-basket on her head with great
respect.</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it!” cried the Patchwork Girl,
springing out of her seat and rattling the crown
jewels defiantly. “The country is all right, but who
ever heard of a Queen doing all the work? It’s
ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Queen Cross Patch liked to work,” muttered
Grumpy. Then, sitting down thoughtlessly on a pin-cushion,
he arose with a loud roar.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t,” said Scraps, while Grumpy, growling
furiously, pulled two needles from his fur. “So
I hope Ozma looks in the Magic Picture soon, but
whether she does or not I shall run off first chance
I get—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Back to the city of sun and song,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Back to the city where I belong!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“It’ll be a long time before they let you,” observed
Grumpy thoughtfully, “and if you try to escape the
Scissor Bird will cut off your head. What would you
do then?”</p>

<p>“Have it sewed on again,” declared Scraps stoutly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
but she shivered a little at the prospect and in a
slightly shaky voice inquired, “Don’t you know any
games or riddles? No one’s around now and we
might as well have some fun.”</p>

<p>Grumpy shook his head, then brightening up a
little he slid out of his chair. “Cross Patch and I
always cuffed each other a bit after dinner,” he said
casually.</p>

<p>“Cuffed each other!” gasped Scraps. “What for?”</p>

<p>“For practice,” explained Grumpy solemnly. “You
have no idea how many new cross words we learned
that way. It’s simply astonishing what cross words
you can think of when someone thumps you on the
ear. Come on—let’s try it. You’ll need to know a
lot of cross words.” Drawing back his fuzzy arm,
Grumpy gave the Patchwork Girl a cuff that sent her
flying into the corner.</p>

<p>“What a pleasant pastime!” puffed Scraps, picking
herself up with a flounce. “Do you call that fun?”
she demanded, shaking the dust scornfully out of
her skirts.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you want to do then?” mumbled the
little bear sullenly. “That’s the only game I know.
Say, someone’s at the door! Listen!”</p>

<p>Someone certainly was. First, the bell rang long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
and clangingly. Then came such a series of thumps,
kicks and slams that all the cross stitched mottoes
fell sideways.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_064" style="max-width: 46.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_064.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Oh!” shrilled the Patchwork Girl, flinging up her
arms joyously, “I know. Ozma has sent someone to
rescue me. Come on Grumpy, we’ll let them in.”</p>

<p>“How do you know it’s rescuers?” shivered the little
bear anxiously. “They sound like robbers to me!”</p>

<p>“Get out!” cried Scraps, running over to the door.</p>

<p>“We can’t get out,” Grumpy reminded her patiently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
“for we’re locked in good and tight.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” sighed the Patchwork Girl, pressing
her cotton nose to the window bars. “They’ll have
to break down the door.”</p>

<p>“Sounds as if they had,” sputtered the little bear,
as a terrible crash sounded from the hallway. “Here
they come!” Jumping head first into the chest
Grumpy pulled down the lid.</p>

Peter Flies With An Odd Bird</h2>


<p>“Nothing at all ever happens here,” exclaimed
Peter, digging his hands deep into his pockets
and staring discontentedly out of the window.</p>

<p>“There’s a balloon man on the corner,” chuckled
his grandfather, who was standing just behind Peter.
“Go buy yourself a balloon.” With another chuckle
he dropped a quarter into Peter’s hand and went
back to his evening paper.</p>

<p>“I’m too old for balloons,” said Peter with great
disgust. “I should think you’d know that, grandfather.”</p>

<p>“Then buy me one,” laughed the old gentleman,
winking provokingly. There was no use arguing
with a person like that, so Peter, fully intending to
buy some marbles and a double nut sundae, ran
out of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Peter’s home was in Philadelphia, facing on a large
public square and the balloon man, his boisterous
wares nearly tugging him off his feet, stood on the
corner nearest Peter. There was something mysterious
about the man. His face was dark and merry
and his long pointed beard and slouch hat gave him
the appearance of a merchant from some far country,
so that in spite of himself Peter stopped.</p>

<p>“A balloon, young gentleman?” inquired the
dealer, bowing politely to the little boy. “What do
you say to this one?” Separating a bright green one
from the bunch, he held it out invitingly.</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Peter doubtfully. He liked
being called a young gentleman, and the more he
looked at the green balloon, the more it fascinated
him. The balloon man had already seen the quarter
in Peter’s hand and quickly stating that twenty-five
cents was the price, he thrust the balloon upon
Peter and pocketed his quarter, all so quickly the
little boy fairly gasped. Why, he had not even made
up his mind to buy, and yet here he was with the
green balloon and there was the man with his quarter.
Uncertainly, Peter stood staring at the balloon
man.</p>

<p>“It’s a bird!” whispered the merchant, leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
forward to touch the balloon lovingly with the tips
of his fingers. “Ah-h-h!” As the balloon man said
“Ah!” a crowd of Peter’s friends turned the corner
and not wishing them to catch him with anything
so babyish as a balloon, Peter started to run across
the square. And never had Peter run so easily.
Each step took him four or five paces ahead, and
when he found himself bounding entirely over the
fountain in the center of the square, he wisely
decided to stop running. So he did, but it made no
difference. His legs stopped moving, to be sure, but
Peter himself shot upward, soaring lightly as a
feather over tree tops, house tops, huge buildings
and church steeples. Not until the tall figure of
William Penn, on the Town Hall, faded into the
merest dot, did Peter remember the balloon man’s
words.</p>

<p>“Why, it <i>is</i> a bird,” murmured the startled boy,
blinking at the comical creature above him. The
stem of the balloon to which he clung had turned
to a strong stiff leg, while the balloon itself had expanded
into a plump, green balloon bird. It careened
through the air without any motion of wings or body
and for a while, Peter, hanging to its leg, was too
frightened to open his mouth. The city had disappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
long ago and, as they pushed up toward the
clouds, Peter, regaining a little of his courage, gave
the bird’s leg a sharp pull. “Stop!” shouted Peter
in as commanding a voice as he could muster.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_070" style="max-width: 121em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_070.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Stop yourself,” retorted the balloon bird sharply,
and the words came in tiny explosions like the pop
pop of an air gun. “Do you think I enjoy having
my leg pulled?” it chirped indignantly.</p>

<p>“But where are we going?” cried Peter anxiously.</p>

<p>“Balloon Island!” popped the bird, bending its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
head to get a better view of the little boy. “Hold
tight, for if you let go, you’ll probably puncture
yourself on a steeple.”</p>

<p>Peter had been thinking this very thing himself.
“You are a present to Queen Luna from Sandaroo,”
continued the bird calmly. “She needed an airrend
boy, so Sandaroo sent you.”</p>

<p>“The balloon man?” gasped Peter, scarcely believing
his ears.</p>

<p>“He’s not a balloon man,” replied the bird disdainfully.
“He’s Lord High Bouncer of Balloona. You
were picked for airrend boy,” he continued placidly,
“because you look strong and stout and because
the balloon boys on the island are always puncturing
themselves or exploding. Did you ever explode?”
asked the bird severely.</p>

<p>“People don’t explode,” answered the little boy
scornfully, “and I’m not going to be an errand boy
for a lot of balloonatics either,” he shouted angrily.
“You’d better let me go or I’ll tell my grandfather
on you.”</p>

<p>“Let go if you want to,” said the bird carelessly.
“You’re holding on to me aren’t you?” This was
only too true, and after one dizzy look downward,
Peter tightened his clutch on the balloon bird’s leg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
and wondered desperately what to do. “You must
tread lightly when we land on the island,” warned
the balloon bird, after a short silence, during which
they covered miles of air, “but I daresay it will be all
right after you are blown up.”</p>

<p>“Blown up,” coughed Peter, “why, what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, you wouldn’t do as you are,” murmured
the bird, rolling its eyes disapprovingly down at the
little boy, “so the Queen has a splendid plan. She
will cut a tiny hole in your back and then have you
blown up till you can float as easily as we do. Oh,
you’ll enjoy floating,” promised the balloon bird,
diving through a moist cloud bank.</p>

<p>Peter doubted that he would enjoy floating, he
doubted it very much, and the more he thought about
being blown up and the hole that was to be cut in
his back the more dreadfully uneasy he became. His
arms ached from the long swing through the air
and, as the balloon bird plunged through a particularly
black cloud, Peter took a long breath and let go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp54" id="i_073" style="max-width: 41.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_073.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Maybe ... I’ll land ... on ... something ... soft!”
panted Peter, as he turned over and over and then
dropped straight downward. “Anyway, it won’t be
any worse than being cut and blown up.” He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
fallen several miles by this time and it was so confusing,
tumbling through clouds and air-ways, and the
wind made such a frightful whistling in his ears, he
finally gave up thinking altogether and closed his
eyes.</p>

<p><i>Splash!</i> With a terrific slap, Peter struck the surface
of a shining blue ocean, the force of his fall carrying
him to the very bottom, where he bumped his
head severely on a clam shell. Dazed and choking,
Peter rose to the surface and almost mechanically
began to swim. After several strokes, he shook the
water from his eyes and looked around him. Then he
gave a little exclamation of excitement and relief.
Not more than twenty paces off lay a small, straggly
looking island.</p>

<p>“Well, this is better than being blown up,” gulped
Peter, heading straight for the island. “Maybe some
fishermen live here and maybe some boats pass. Gee
whillikens, won’t grandfather be surprised when he
hears about this, though!”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_075" style="max-width: 64.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_075.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Immensely cheered, Peter cut swiftly through the
choppy blue waves, and the water was soon shallow
enough for him to wade ashore. The island was not
much larger than the public square at home. A few
sea gulls circled aimlessly overhead, but so far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
Peter could see there were no people or houses. First
he walked completely round the island, then, feeling
rather depressed, started across. The soil was poor
and rocky and there were only about a dozen trees
altogether. When he had come to the top of a small
hill, Peter sank down on a heap of rocks and began
to wring the water from his coat. How long he
sat there wondering what he should eat, how he
should endure the loneliness or ever find his way
back to Philadelphia, Peter never knew. But he suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
became aware of a rattle and rumble below and
out from the opposite side of the rock heap sprang
a perfectly furious little man. He was gray as the
rocks himself, and his long, wispy white hair and
beard blew and snapped in the wind.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_076" style="max-width: 67.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_076.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Get off my chimney, idiot!” screamed the old gentleman,
dancing wrathfully up and down. “Can’t
you see you’re filling my cave with smoke?”</p>

<p>Stopping right in the middle of his dance, he glared
long and searchingly at the little boy. Then, bursting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
into loud sobs, he began to hop ’round and ’round
on one leg, wiping his tears on his whiskers and fairly
sizzling with indignation.</p>

<p>“To think!” he shouted, raising his arms to the
Heavens, “To think, that after five years of loneliness
a miserable mortal should fall on this island! Why
couldn’t it have been a gnome or a witch or somebody
real and interesting. I hate children,” shrieked the
angry little fellow, stamping his curly foot at Peter.</p>

<p>Peter had been so startled by the sudden appearance
of the old gentleman and then so surprised at
his curious actions that he had said nothing at all.
But now he jumped angrily off the rock heap. “He’s
no bigger than I am,” thought Peter courageously,
“and he needn’t think he can talk to me like that. Is
this your island?” he asked stiffly.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s my island!” spluttered the little
man. “Go away, I hate children.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help that,” answered Peter. “Besides,
I’m not a child. I’m nine years old and in the
Fifth-B.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care what you’re in,” shrilled the little
islander. “You’re in my way now, and if I had my
magic belt I’d turn you to a potato and mash you for
supper. Don’t you know I’m a King?” he squealed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
thumping himself three times upon the chest.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t act like one,” answered Peter, in
disgust. “If you are the King of this island I wish
you’d give me some supper and a place to sleep.”</p>

<p>“King of this island!” screamed the angry little
man. “I’m Ruggedo, the Rough, the one and only
Metal Monarch and ruler over five hundred thousand
gnomes besides.”</p>

<p>“Gnomes!” murmured Peter, pushing back his cap.
He had read about these underground elves, who
mine all the precious stones in and out of the world,
but he had never really believed in them.</p>

<p>“Yes, gnomes!” boasted the little grey gentleman,
marching proudly up and down.</p>

<p>“Where are they?” inquired Peter, a little anxiously.
For, thought Peter to himself, if they are
all as cross and tempery as this one, life on the island
is going to be very unpleasant and dangerous.</p>

<p>“You stand there and ask me that,” howled the
Gnome King furiously. “Don’t you know I’ve been
banished from my Kingdom for years and made a
prisoner on this ridiculous little island, just because
I tried to get back my magic belt from Ozma of Oz?
Don’t you know it was a miserable child who stole
it in the first place. I hate children,” repeated the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
Gnome King, clutching his hair with both hands and
snapping his wicked little eyes at Peter.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_079" style="max-width: 78.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_079.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“If you’ve been here all that time by yourself I
should think you’d be glad to have someone to talk
to,” ventured the little boy, seating himself carefully
on a rock. “I read a book about Oz once,” he went on
in an interested voice, “but I didn’t know it was really
true. Is Ozma still Queen and does Dorothy still live
in the Emerald City?”</p>

<p>“Dorothy’s the girl who stole my belt,” sputtered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
Ruggedo, for it was the Gnome King. “If you have
read about Dorothy, you must know about me.”</p>

<p>“You weren’t in the book I read,” explained Peter
patiently, “but if you know Dorothy and Ozma, they
must be real and if we are near Oz, maybe you can
tell me how to get there?”</p>

<p>“If I knew do you suppose I’d be here?” yelled
Ruggedo. Picking up a rock, he flung it at Peter’s
head and rushed violently into his cavern. Peter
dodged the rock and, almost wishing he had stuck
with the balloon bird, stared dejectedly out to sea.
The sun was sinking in the west and the prospect of
a long stay on the barren island with the dreadful
little Gnome King was not at all cheering.</p>

<p>“I’ll probably starve to death,” sighed Peter, kicking
gloomily at a stone. Then, remembering some
string in his pocket, he pulled it out and, fastening a
small piece of wire on the string, started toward the
beach with the intention of catching a few fish for his
dinner. Halfway there, he came to a small sluggish
stream and, casting his line into its muddy waters,
sat down to wait for a bite. He had no matches but
thought maybe if he caught a few fish and offered
Ruggedo one he might allow him to cook over his fire.</p>

<p>Now Ruggedo had fully intended to stay in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
cave and not speak another word to Peter, but finally
his curiosity got the best of him. After you have
been all alone for five years, even a creature you despise
is better than no one at all, so presently he came
stalking out again. Peter had in the meantime decided
to be as polite as possible to the old gnome, for
no one could help him. Therefore, as Ruggedo approached,
puffing away at a short clay pipe, he waved
to him quite cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Don’t wave at me,” wheezed Ruggedo, taking his
pipe out of his mouth and frowning darkly. “I’m a
King, I am!”</p>

<p>“Oh, what difference does that make?” said Peter
impatiently. “We’re both stranded, aren’t we? Let’s
stop quarreling and try to find a way off the island.
Don’t boats ever stop here and how far away is this
land of Oz, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Boats!” scoffed the Gnome King, “I’ve been here
five years and not one boat has passed. As for Oz,
you are in the very middle of the Nonestic Ocean
and about as far from Oz as you could possibly be.”</p>

<p>“You mean to say you’ve been here five years?”
gasped Peter incredulously, “and nothing has happened
in all that time?”</p>

<p>“Nothing—but you,” answered the Gnome King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“Well, you needn’t think I’m going to stay that
long,” blustered Peter, jerking at his fish line in great
agitation. “I’ll build a boat, or a raft or something.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp59" id="i_082" style="max-width: 59.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_082.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Taking his pipe from his mouth, the old gnome
looked at Peter almost respectfully. He had often
thought of building a raft himself but, being a King
and naturally quite unskillful and lazy, he had never
really gotten down to it.</p>

<p>“If you help me off this island,” he puffed after a
short pause, “I’ll make you the richest boy in the
world.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted Peter, not much impressed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
the old gnome’s promises. Just then, his line gave a
tug and he was pulling it up quite joyfully when Ruggedo
seized his arm.</p>

<p>“Look!” shuddered the gnome, pointing a trembling
finger out to sea. Not far from the island, the
waters of the Nonestic Ocean were boiling and churning
in a terrifying manner. As Peter jumped to his
feet, the waves arose in a mighty green wall and,
with a deafening roar, came crashing downward.</p>

Sea Tips Upside Down In Quake</h2>


<p>Flung flat upon their faces by the terrific shock,
it was some time before either Ruggedo or Peter
had the courage to look up. Then Peter, rubbing the
sand and dust from his eyes, raised his head and
stared fearfully out to sea. What he saw made him
blink with astonishment. The sea had turned itself
upside down and on top of the waves, and almost
touching Ruggedo’s island, lay a long gleaming
stretch of sea bottom.</p>

<p>Crystal caverns and sea grottos, coral walls and
castles glittered and shimmered in the last rays of
the setting sun and, rushing toward the edges of the
strange morass was every sort of sea creature Peter
ever had imagined. Giant fish wallowed desperately
toward the sides and hurled themselves back into
the water. Peter rubbed his eyes again to be sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
he was not dreaming and, as a golden haired mermaid
plunged boldly from the window of a coral
castle, he made a grab for Ruggedo. But Ruggedo
was already on his crooked little legs.</p>

<p>“Come on! Come on!” wheezed the old Gnome
King frantically. “Can’t you see it’s a way off the
island?”</p>

<p>In a daze, Peter ran after him and jumped across
the small stretch of water separating their island
from the mysterious sea country. It extended as far
ahead as they could see.</p>

<p>“Hurry! Hurry!” urged Ruggedo, stumbling over
slippery rocks and pausing every few moments to
disentangle himself from the oozy arms of some
clutching sea plant. “It may go straight to the
shores of Ev!” panted the gnome, giving no attention
to the frightful sea monsters who were rushing
past him in an effort to fling themselves back into
the water. “Come on! Come on!”</p>

<p>Shuddering a little, as he collided with an octopus,
Peter came. Now they were wading knee deep in
green slime, with lobsters, crabs, turtles, jiggers and
jelly fish squirming and wiggling uncomfortably
against their legs.</p>

<p>Peter wanted to stop at the first coral castle, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
Ruggedo ran scornfully past. An old Merman, sitting
sadly on the top step, reminded Peter of his
grandfather. He wanted to stop and sympathize
with the old gentleman, but fearing to be left alone
in so scaresome and strange a country, he hurried
after the Gnome King. Then Peter saw that which
made all else fade from his mind. It was the battered
hulk of an old ship, resting against the side of
a green sea cavern. It was overgrown with sea moss
and barnacles, but the name, in raised letters of pure
gold, was still visible.</p>

<p>“Blunderoo!” breathed Peter softly. Then snatching
at Ruggedo’s coat-tails forced him to stop.</p>

<p>“Let’s go aboard!” puffed Peter. “I’ll bet we’ll
find all sorts of useful things. Oh Jimminee! Look!
It’s a pirate ship!”</p>

<p>Peter pointed to the gold skull and cross bones below
the ship’s name, his voice trembling with eagerness.
Even Ruggedo’s eyes began to snap and
sparkle with excitement.</p>

<p>“That would mean treasure chests,” muttered the
old gnome greedily. There was a rusty chain ladder
hanging over the ship’s side and, seizing the lowest
rung, Peter swung himself up and in less than no time
had reached the ship’s deck. How long it had lain at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the bottom of the sea was hard to say, but the planks
were water soaked and rotten and everything was
crumbling with rust and decay. As the Gnome King
dropped down beside Peter, a thunderous explosion
shook the boards beneath their feet.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_088" style="max-width: 80.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_088.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Another one!” roared Ruggedo, clapping his
hands over his ears.</p>

<p>“Another what?” shouted Peter, who was not quite
sure what had happened in the first place.</p>

<p>“Sea quake!” quavered the gnome, cowering back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
against the ship’s cabin. And Ruggedo was right.
For a moment longer the strange stretch of sea bed
quivered on the surface of the waves. Then, with a
splash, grind and rumble, it went crashing back to
the bottom and the hungry waves of the Nonestic
Ocean tossed and tumbled over the place where it
had been.</p>

<p>Now the same terrific shock that hurled the sea
land back to the depths of the ocean dislodged the
crumbling old pirate wreck and hurled it high into
the air. With a shattering smack it smote the churning
waters, rocked violently backward and forward,
finally righting itself.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be scuppered!” Letting go of the ring
in the cabin door to which he had clung during the
whole excitement, Ruggedo slid down to a sitting
position on the deck. Peter, with one arm hooked
about the ship’s railing, was so surprised to find himself
alive that he did not speak for several moments.</p>

<p>“Well!” he coughed finally, “at least we have a
boat!”</p>

<p>“If we hadn’t come aboard we’d have been at the
bottom of the sea by this time,” shuddered Ruggedo,
as Peter sank down beside him. “I believe you’ve
brought me good luck, boy, and when I reach my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
kingdom I’ll make you general of all my armies.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” murmured Peter, smiling faintly, “but
I’ll have to be getting back to Philadelphia. My
grandfather will be worried, besides I’m captain of
our baseball team and there’s a big game on soon.”</p>

<p>“Would you rather be captain of a baseball team
than an army?” asked Ruggedo, staring at the little
boy in real amazement. He didn’t know just what a
baseball team was, but felt that it could not compare
with his army of gnomes.</p>

<p>“Of course,” answered Peter, in a matter of fact
voice, “but if we’re going to get anywhere we’ll have
to steer the ship.” The sun had sunk down into the
sea by this time and it was growing darker and
darker. Stepping carefully along the rail, for the
ship was still plunging and pitching terribly, Peter
made a careful survey. But the rudder was gone,
the masts crumbled to mere stumps and not a vestige
of the sails remained.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to drift,” called Peter resignedly.
Scarcely hearing him, the old gnome nodded. Already
a hundred plans were skimming through his wicked
little head—plans to reinstate himself as Metal Monarch,
revenge himself upon Ozma and Dorothy and
destroy once and for all the Emerald City of Oz. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
tides of the Nonestic Ocean were very strong, and he
felt that sooner or later they would be carried to
the shores of Ev, under the surface of which lay his
own vast dominions. Directly across the Deadly
Desert from Ev, lay Oz, and when he reached his own
kingdom some means of crossing the desert would
have to be devised.</p>

<p>While Ruggedo was planning all this, Peter was
busily exploring the ship. He would have liked to
descend into the hold of the pirate vessel, but it was
already too dark to venture down, and as he was
very hungry, he began to look around for something
to eat. Fortunately the decks were still full of wiggling
sea creatures that had failed to get back in the
water after the sea quake. Peter threw most of
them overboard, keeping only three tiny fish for his
dinner. These he killed, cleaned and scaled with his
pocket knife and, borrowing Ruggedo’s pipe which
quite miraculously had stayed lit, kindled a small
fire in an iron pot and broiled them most satisfactorily.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_092" style="max-width: 78.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_092.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Ruggedo refused to share Peter’s dinner, crunching
up instead a handful of pebbles he had in his
pocket. As the moon rose the sea grew calmer and,
riding up and down the silvered waves, the strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
ship mates sat conversing together. Delighted to be
off the lonely island, impressed by Peter’s enterprise
and spirit, Ruggedo had grown almost friendly. He
listened quite pleasantly, while Peter told how the
balloon bird had carried him off and then in his turn
related a bit of his own history. He first explained
to the little boy how Dorothy had captured his magic
belt, which seemed to be his most treasured possession,
and how she had given it to Ozma. Pulling away
at his pipe, he spoke of his many efforts to recover his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
property, but always, it seemed, through no fault of
his own, he had been defeated. After his last attempt
he related how Ozma had banished him to the
lonely island where Peter had found him.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_093" style="max-width: 60.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_093.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Well, why bother with the belt?” asked Peter, a
little sleepily, as the gnome paused to knock the ashes
from his pipe. “If you have all the riches you say
you have, and are ruler over five hundred thousand
gnomes, why do you need this belt?”</p>

<p>“Because it is my most magic possession,” explained
Ruggedo impatiently. “With the magic belt
one can change people into any shape or form whatsoever
and transport them where one desires. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
don’t you see that so long as Ozma has this belt, I
am in her power?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_094" style="max-width: 64.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_094.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“I suppose so,” yawned Peter, but he couldn’t help
reflecting, from what he had read of Ozma and what
he already knew of Ruggedo, that the magic belt
was far safer with the little fairy ruler of Oz.</p>

<p>“Why did Dorothy take it from you in the first
place?” he inquired drowsily.</p>

<p>“Just because I wanted to transform her and a
few of those useless Oz people into ornaments for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
my palace,” complained Ruggedo in a grieved voice.</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Peter and, chuckling a little to
himself, curled into a more comfortable position. The
deck was hard and wet, but Peter, thinking over the
strange events of the day, did not even notice. Up
to now, he had believed in the usual things of life,
like grandfathers, school, baseball, circuses, vacations
in summer, plenty of friends and fun. To suddenly
be confronted by balloon birds, gnomes, fairy
kingdoms and sea quakes was terribly confusing.
Peter tried his best to figure it all out but, lulled by
the motion of the ship and the monotonous drone of
Ruggedo’s voice, he finally fell into a deep slumber.</p>

Ruggedo Discovers Pirate’s Treasure</h2>


<p>When Peter awakened, the sun was already high
in the heavens and the sea a glittering, dancing
expanse of blue. Stretching his arms joyously, Peter
bounded to his feet, not even minding the little stiffness
he felt from his long sleep on deck. The ship
was rolling along comfortably with the current, and
Ruggedo was nowhere in sight. Tiptoeing over to
the cabin, Peter peered in the window, but he was
not there.</p>

<p>“He’s gone below, I guess,” decided Peter, and
started down the broken ladder that led into the
ship’s hold. The port holes, still overgrown with moss
and sea weed, let in only a dim, green light but, even
so, Peter could see that the walls were hung with
rusty swords and muskets, while all about the sides
stood old iron sea chests and boxes and rotting sacks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
spilling out their gleaming contents of gold and silver
coins. Before the largest sea chest, crouched the
old Gnome King. He was crooning happily to himself
and running his fingers through the sparkling
jewels that filled the chest to the very top.</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed Peter, pausing with both hands
on his hips, “this is a find!”</p>

<p>“I found it first! I found it first!” babbled Ruggedo.
“They’re mine, Peter, all mine! You may
have the gold pieces,” he finished jealously. Disgusted
with the greedy old gnome, Peter shrugged
his shoulders. The gold pieces seemed more desirable
any way. Giving no further attention to Ruggedo,
he sank down before one of the bulging sacks
and began planning what he should do with his treasure.
First, he would build a splendid club house for
the team, with hot and cold showers, and next he
would buy himself and the gang motorcycles, ponies
and canoes! His grandfather should have a new
automobile and twenty-five pair of specs, so he’d
always have one pair handy. After that—</p>

<p>Clasping his knees and fixing his eyes dreamily
upon the beamed ceiling, Peter fell into such pleasant
reveries that it was nearly 10 o’clock before he
so much as thought of breakfast. Then he suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
realized he was dreadfully thirsty and went hurrying
up the ladder in search of water and provisions. “I
hope there are some left,” muttered Peter anxiously,
“something in tins or bottles that the salt water
hasn’t got into.”</p>

<p>The cabin was a mass of wreckage but opening
from that was a small narrow pantry that had evidently
been the ship’s galley. The shelves had rotted
and fallen to the floor. Sand and shells sifted back
and forth with the motion of the boat, but in the
darkest corner Peter found a heap of casks and tins.
Seizing one of the square boxes and a cask, Peter
raced out on deck and after some trouble managed
to uncork the strangely shaped vessel.</p>

<p>Ah! Water! Sparkling, cold and clear! Peter
almost emptied the cask, then, knocking open a box
with a piece of wreckage, he found it full of hard,
salty ship’s biscuits. Smiling to think how long this
breakfast had been waiting for him, Peter ate heartily,
for when you are hungry even a stale biscuit
tastes delicious. Satisfied at last, he took the biscuits
and cask below.</p>

<p>Without even a “thank you,” Ruggedo gulped
down the water and gobbled up the biscuits, which
were hard enough to suit even him. Then, wiping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
his mouth upon his ragged sleeve, he fell to fingering
the pirate’s jewels again, bending as lovingly over
the sea chest as a mother bends over a cradle. After
several unsuccessful attempts to draw Ruggedo into
a conversation, Peter gave up and went poking
around the great dim interior to see what else he
could find. Shreds that were once the pirates’ coats
clung to the nails on the wall and below one of these
nails Peter picked up a small metal bound book.
Water had blurred all the first pages but, carrying
it up to the light, Peter found the last page quite
legible. It was the Pirate Chief’s diary and, thrilled
to his last bone, Peter pored over the pirate’s final
entry.</p>

<p>“I, Polacky, the Plunderer,” said the thin, angular
writing, “did this day capture the Island of Ashangabad,
taking from the islanders ten chests of gold,
three bags of silver, the crown and jewels of state,
together with the magic casket of Soob, the Sorcerer.
The treasure will I divide, but the magic appliances
hold for myself in case of mutiny or capture.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_101" style="max-width: 70.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_101.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>As he read, Peter could almost see the swaggering
old Pirate Chief and his men swarming over the
strangely named and defenseless little island. There
were some further remarks about the winds and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
tides, but what interested Peter was the magic casket.
“I do wonder what he did with it?” mused the
little boy. “Maybe there might be some magic in it
that would take me back to Philadelphia.” Deciding
to say nothing of his discovery to Ruggedo, Peter
went below and began a systematic search, poking
behind the great chests and bags and tapping on the
dank walls for secret cupboards or hollow boards.
He had completely circled the treasure room without
any success, and was standing on the spot where he
picked up the diary, before he made any progress at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
all. Then, looking down, he noticed that the plank
beneath his feet was raised up higher than the others.
It might easily have been swollen out of place by the
action of the water but, bending down, Peter began
to pry at the board. At the second tug it came up
altogether, revealing a square, box-like enclosure.
In the enclosure lay a small carved casket of jade, a
ruby key on top.</p>

<p>Forgetting the necessity for caution, Peter gave
a shriek of excitement and, falling upon his knees
before the opening, reached eagerly down for the
magic box. To fit the key in the lock and open the
casket was the work of but a moment. He was a bit
disappointed to find what looked like a package of
grey gauze, a small uncut emerald and an ivory box
with a few directions on the lid. Placing the smaller
objects on the floor beside him, Peter unrolled the
grey package. It proved to be a long, misty cape,
and on the collar was a tiny tag stitched in green.</p>

<p>“The Flying Cloak of Invisibility,” announced the
tag. “Renders wearer invisible and takes him wheresoever
he desires to go.”</p>

<p>With a sharp exclamation of delight, Peter arose
and was about to fling the magic cloak around him
when it was snatched roughly from behind. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
the old Gnome King, of course. For several minutes
he had been peering over Peter’s shoulder and had
also read the legend on the green tag.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_103" style="max-width: 72.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_103.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Take me to the Emerald City!” shouted Ruggedo,
wrapping himself in the misty folds of the gray garment.
Too startled to even try to recover his property,
Peter stood blinking at the old gnome. But he
neither disappeared nor whirled off in a cloud of silver
dust, as Peter had expected him to do. In fact,
nothing happened to him at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“What kind of a miserable mumpish magician
made this?” stormed Ruggedo, dragging off the cloak
and holding it up to the light.</p>

<p>“Well, you had no business to take it in the first
place,” burst out Peter angrily. “I found the magic
casket and the cloak is mine! What good would it
have done, any way, if it had carried you to the
Emerald City?” he continued more calmly. “You
would have left all this treasure behind and had no
one to help you capture your belt.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” admitted Ruggedo, sitting down with
the cloak in his lap. “If I had gone you would have
taken all the jewels for yourself.”</p>

<p>“You bet I would.” Folding his arms Peter stared
sternly down at the mean little gnome. “Why can’t
you play fair?” he demanded indignantly.</p>

<p>“Well, weren’t you going to fly back to Philadelphia
and leave me?” asked Ruggedo triumphantly.
“Hah! Hah! You’re no better than I am. That’s
why I like you,” he finished maliciously.</p>

<p>Peter blushed a little at the Gnome King’s shrewd
guess. He had been going to wish himself back to
Philadelphia, but pretending not to care, he swept
up the other treasures from the magic box and put
them into his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“If you keep the cloak, I shall keep these!” he announced
firmly, “and I know why the cloak won’t
work, too!”</p>

<p>“Why?” In spite of himself, Ruggedo’s voice
trembled with eagerness.</p>

<p>“Oh—because!” Smiling provokingly and whistling
a careless tune, Peter climbed up the ladder.
Ruggedo was after him in a flash.</p>

<p>“Tell me!” begged the gnome in his most coaxing
voice. “Don’t you realize that with the magic cloak
I can fly into Ozma’s palace and recover my belt without
being detected. And when I do,” he promised
earnestly, “I’ll transport you immediately back to
Philadelphia—you and all the gold pieces.”</p>

<p>“Promise?” Ruggedo nodded so vigorously his
hair blew backward and forward seven times.</p>

<p>“All right then,” agreed Peter, leaning against the
rail of the Blunderoo. “It won’t fly because it’s torn.”
Holding the cloak up, Ruggedo saw that Peter was
right. There was a large hole in the back and a rent
reaching from the collar to the hem.</p>

<p>“Huh, my gnomes can soon mend that,” boasted
Ruggedo in relief, “and then let Miss Ozma of Oz
look to her crown! I’ll fly to the Emerald City, steal
my belt, and I’ll turn her to a canary and clap her into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
a gold cage. I’ll clap them all into cages!” roared
Ruggedo, beginning to bounce up and down like a
rubber ball. “There won’t be one emerald left upon
the other, when I get through with them. Banish
me for five years! Take away my Kingdom! I’ll
show them!”</p>

<p>Forgetting all about Peter, the old Gnome King
stamped, shrieked and threatened till the little boy
in disgust retired to the other side of the ship. He
could easily have taken the cloak away from Ruggedo,
but wisely decided to wait. “If we ever do reach
this Kingdom of his and the cloak is properly mended
I’ll take it myself, fly to the Emerald City and warn
Ozma that the Gnome King is free,” resolved Peter,
staring dreamily at the tumbling blue waves. “And
once in the Emerald City, Ozma will surely send me
back to Philadelphia with the magic belt.” Having
settled all this to his satisfaction, the little boy pulled
out the other possessions of Soob, the Sorcerer. The
emerald was covered with strange markings, but
Peter could make nothing of them, so he put it back
into his pocket and opened the ivory box.</p>

<p>“In case of extreme danger, plant these,” advised
a pink slip on top of the box. “These” proved to be
two onions, or at least they looked like onions. Peter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
had hoped to find something exciting, like a wishing
ring, and putting the onions back, he closed the box
with a little sigh. Then, clasping his hands behind
his head, he fell to thinking about the pirates and
wondering why there were no bones on board.</p>

<p>“They must have taken to the small boats and
escaped when the Blunderoo sank,” concluded Peter
and, having disposed of this question, began wondering
what his friends in Philadelphia were doing.
He was sorry indeed to have his grandfather worried
by his absence, but could not help feeling a little important
at the commotion it must be causing.
“They’ve probably called in the police by now,”
mused Peter, and he hoped that when his grandfather
gave his picture to the reporters he would remember
to mention that Peter was Captain of the
A. P. Baseball Team. In fancy, he saw the large
headlines in the morning papers when the news of
his final return did get out.</p>

<p>“‘Young Philadelphia Boy Finds Treasure Ship
and Saves the Emerald City of Oz!’ That wouldn’t
be bad,” thought Peter, and was going over in his
mind just how he would describe the sea quake and
his other strange adventures when a loud screech
from Ruggedo called him to the side of the ship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>“Land!” shouted the Gnome King, with an excited
wave toward the west. And it was land. Rolling
gently in with the tide, the Blunderoo was approaching
a long shallow beach.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_108" style="max-width: 68.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_108.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“We’ll probably go aground,” exclaimed Peter,
looking anxiously over the side. “It’s a good thing
the waves are not any larger. What country do you
suppose it is, Rug?” Ruggedo had been staring intently
ahead and now jumped at least three feet into
the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>“Why, it’s Ev!” croaked the Gnome King, hoarse
with delight. “Ev! Ev! Ev! The most beautiful
country in the world. My country, Peter!”</p>

<p>“Looks like a wilderness to me,” puffed the little
boy, but even Peter felt strangely elated and gay.
He had not really believed the old gnome’s story of
his vast dominions, but if this was Ev, he must have
been telling the truth. “I don’t see any castle!” he
murmured, leaning far out over the rail.</p>

<p>“Underground!” panted Ruggedo. “Caverns!
Caves! Labyrinths and everything. Wait till you
see them, Peter. You’ll never want to go back to
Philadelphia again. Wait!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_7">CHAPTER 7<br>
Kaliko Falls As King of Gnomes</h2>


<p>Every wash and slap of the waves sent the battered
old hull of the Blunderoo nearer to shore
and, at last, with a tired groan, it stuck its nose into
the sand and, listing over sideways, came to a creaky
stop.</p>

<p>“Have you the cloak?” asked Peter, one leg already
over the rail. Ruggedo held up the small gray package,
but looked doubtfully at the foaming waves
below.</p>

<p>“How are we going to get to the beach?” he
frowned uneasily.</p>

<p>“Lived here all your life and can’t swim?” exclaimed
Peter. “Great goldfish! Come on, I’ll help
you,” he added impatiently, as the gnome continued
to stare uncertainly down at the water. Hurrying
down the ladder, Peter dropped easily into the sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
and after a good bit of coaxing, Ruggedo slipped in
after him. Taking a firm hold on the gnome’s long
whiskers and with Ruggedo sputtering and sizzling
like a hot coal in a dish pan, Peter struck out for
shore. It was soon shallow enough for them to wade
and in exactly three minutes from the time the Blunderoo
grounded, they stood on the barren shores
of Ev.</p>

<p>Forgetting his discomfort, for gnomes like water
about as much as cats, the metal monarch began to
run as fast as his crooked legs would carry him
toward a group of little hills. Looking round without
much enthusiasm at the dreary waste of sand and
cactus, Peter followed more slowly. His only plan
was to keep a sharp watch over Ruggedo and, as soon
as the cloak was repaired, to take it away from him
and fly to the Emerald City.</p>

<p>“I do hope Ozma can transport the treasure to
Philadelphia with me,” sighed Peter, quickening his
steps as Ruggedo disappeared behind a particularly
large rock. He half expected the gnome would try
to slip away from him but, to tell the truth, Ruggedo
was more kindly disposed toward Peter than toward
any mortal he had ever met. He admired Peter’s
courage and felt that his good fortune was largely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
due to the boy’s enterprise and spirit. Besides, Ruggedo
wished to show off his immense dominions and
treasure caves, so, as Peter rounded the rock, he took
his hand and pressed a hidden spring in the crevice.
Instantly a huge door swung inward and they found
themselves in a long, dim tunnel.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Kaliko still thinks he is King!”
wheezed Ruggedo, pattering along ahead of Peter.
Kaliko had been appointed to rule in Ruggedo’s place
and had been promoted from Royal Chamberlain to
King of the Gnomes. “Ha! Ha!” laughed Ruggedo
maliciously. “He’ll be as pleased as a Gundersnutch
when he sees me back!”</p>

<p>Peter answered nothing to this, for he was too
interested in the underground world in which he
found himself to pay much attention to the old
gnome’s remarks. As they proceeded, a perfect network
of passageways opened from the main tunnel,
the sides, walls and ceilings gleaming with sparkling
jewels. Thousands of gnomes with pick axes were
busily at work digging out the gems and they did
not even look up as Peter and Ruggedo passed them.
Blazing rubies and emeralds set in tall stands lighted
up the strange caverns and Peter’s heart began to
pound with excitement as the passageway broadened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
out into a richly carpeted hallway. Presently they
found themselves before a grilled golden door with
a diamond knob. Without pausing, Ruggedo turned
the knob, opened the door and simply rushed into his
former throne room. On a huge round ruby, hollowed
out to form a seat, a thin, nervous gnome sat
reading a silver sheet about as thick as our morning
papers. It was the Gnome Man’s Daily, and as Peter
and Ruggedo burst noisily into the royal chamber, he
dropped the silver sheet and looked up with an exclamation
of alarm.</p>

<p>“You!” gasped Kaliko, as if he could not believe his
own senses.</p>

<p>“Who else?” snickered Ruggedo, winking at Peter.
“I’ll thank you for my crown, you robber. Take it
right off your Kalikoko. Quick now! Hand it over!”</p>

<p>“Ozma will never consent to this,” stammered
Kaliko, holding to the crown with both hands.</p>

<p>“Ozma has nothing to do with me now,” announced
Ruggedo calmly. “I have magic stronger than Ozma’s
and if you don’t hop off that throne, I’ll turn you to
a ball and bounce you off!”</p>

<p>Peter listened in amazement to Ruggedo’s boasts,
but Kaliko seemed to believe every word. With
quaking knees, he descended the steps of the throne
and held out the crown to his former master.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp55" id="i_115" style="max-width: 40.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_115.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Ha! Ha!” roared Ruggedo, snatching the crown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
and clapping it jauntily on the back of his head.
“You’re enough to make an alligator laugh, Kaliko.
So brave! So kingly! But don’t stand there gibbering
like a dunce. If you are no longer King, you are
still Royal Chamberlain, and this is Peter, future
general of my armies!” Tripping merrily up the
steps of the throne, Ruggedo waved toward the little
boy. “We will shortly make a journey to the Emerald
City,” he announced grandly, “but right now we
desire refreshment. Lunch for two,” he commanded,
putting his finger tips together and leaning back
comfortably. “And, by the way,” he added as an
afterthought, “there is a pirate ship on the beach.
Have it unloaded and the treasure stored in the silver
grotto. Then order me a dozen new suits and send
in the Royal Wizard.”</p>

<p>At each command, Kaliko bowed meekly, and as
Ruggedo picked up the ruby scepter lying on the arm
of the throne, he ducked and ran out the door, for
Ruggedo, as a mere matter of habit, had flung the
scepter after him.</p>

<p>“A blockhead!” sniffed Ruggedo contemptuously,
“but didn’t I manage him well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“He’s not very brave,” admitted Peter, sitting on
the edge of the crystal rocking chair, “but how are
you going to get along without any magic? Suppose
the gnomes don’t want you back again?”</p>

<p>“One thing at a time! One thing at a time!”
beamed Ruggedo, in such a fine humor at his unexpected
turn of luck, he felt almost pleasant. “Let’s
not worry till we have to, General.” Peter couldn’t
help smiling at his new title and, surveying himself
in the long mirror, wondered how he would look in
a gnome uniform. But at this juncture they were interrupted
by the entrance of the Royal Wizard. He
looked frightened and anxious, and Peter could see
from his manner that the old Gnome King was no
great favorite with his former subjects.</p>

<p>“Well, Potaroo!” grinned Ruggedo, taking up the
pipe Kaliko had been smoking, “what have you been
inventing in my absence?”</p>

<p>“Flying dishes,” croaked the magician, looking
curiously at Peter. “They do away with extra servants,
fly backward and forward with the food and
wash and dry themselves as well.”</p>

<p>“Very good!” puffed Ruggedo, complacently.
“Well, here’s another little job for you.” Drawing
out the cloak, he handed it down to the wizened old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
gnome. “Just mend this,” ordered Ruggedo carelessly,
“and have it back by three o’clock.” Spreading
the cloak across his knees, Potaroo examined it
carefully all over. Then backing away from the
throne he shook his head.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_118" style="max-width: 60.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_118.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“That, your Majesty, is impossible,” he muttered
uneasily. “This cloak cannot be mended by gnome
magic.”</p>

<p>“No magic at all?” gasped Peter, disappointed beyond
words, while Ruggedo glared angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“I command you to mend it!” screamed the hot-tempered
little King, looking angrily around for
something to throw at the wizard.</p>

<p>“That makes no difference,” quavered Potaroo,
backing still farther. “This cloak cannot be mended
properly anywhere but in the Kingdom of Patch.”</p>

<p>“And where is Patch?” demanded Ruggedo, emitting
a perfect cloud of pipe smoke.</p>

<p>“In the Winkie Country of Oz, just below the Kingdom
of Ann of Oogaboo,” exclaimed Potaroo, looking
longingly over his shoulder at the door.</p>

<p>“Very well,” snapped Ruggedo disagreeably, “you
may go, but next time your magic fails to work
you’ll be turned to a door mat. A door mat, do you
understand? Hah! Hah! A door mat to stand under
my feet. See!” Ruggedo laughed wickedly, and the
poor wizard, mumbling his sorrow, rushed from the
throne room.</p>

<p>“Rubyation!” blustered Ruggedo, as the door
closed on Potaroo. “Now we’ll have to go to Patch.”</p>

<p>“Well, isn’t that on the way to the Emerald City?”
inquired Peter, very much amused by all that had
happened.</p>

<p>“Yes,” acknowledged Ruggedo, “I suppose it is,
but here comes lunch! Ah! I’m hungry enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
eat a billy goat stuffed with soldier buttons!”</p>

<p>Preceded by two gnomes carrying a huge golden
tray, Kaliko came stepping timidly into the room.
Ruggedo had the usual gnome fare of ground rocks,
pebble pie and muddy coffee; but for Peter, Kaliko
had brought a small steak, fried potatoes and ice
cream. After the hard sea biscuit, this tasted perfectly
delicious, and Peter, not knowing what strange
adventures lay ahead, ate every scrap. Ruggedo, too,
enjoyed his luncheon and amused himself by throwing
the dishes at Kaliko as he finished with them.
Peter wondered why the flying dishes were not in
use, but feeling sorry for the old wizard decided
not to ask.</p>

<p>“You may now pack us up a lunch,” announced
Ruggedo, as he swallowed the last of his coffee.
“We’re starting for the Emerald City almost at
once.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to cross the desert?” inquired
Kaliko. Angry as he was at the old Gnome King, he
could not help feeling curious about his plans.</p>

<p>“Magic! Old Cauliflower! Magic! How do you
suppose I got off the island?” wheezed Ruggedo
haughtily. “Don’t stand there stuttering. Fetch me
a new suit and hurry along with the lunch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Shrugging his thin shoulders, and turning up his
eyes, Kaliko did as he was told, and in less than an
hour Peter and the Gnome King were wending their
way over the rocky hills of Ev. Ruggedo had the
magic cloak tucked carefully under his arm and
Peter carried a small basket of provisions.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_121" style="max-width: 57.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_121.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“How <i>are</i> we going to cross this desert?” asked
Peter, looking with interest down toward the beach
where the gnomes were busily at work unloading the
treasure from the Blunderoo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” confessed Ruggedo quite frankly,
“but if Kaliko had discovered I had not magic enough
to cross the desert, he would have roused the gnomes
and kicked us out of the kingdom.”</p>

<p>“Is there no other way to Oz?” sighed Peter. He
was growing a little anxious about ever reaching
Philadelphia in time for the baseball game.</p>

<p>“Nope!” puffed the Gnome King, trudging along
sturdily. “The Deadly Desert surrounds the whole
country. It’s supposed to keep people out of Oz,”
he finished with a malicious wink. “But it has been
crossed before and can be crossed again, though I’m
sure I don’t know how.”</p>

<p>The entrance of the Gnome King’s caverns was
quite near the edge of the Deadly Desert, so it was
not long before they reached this dangerous expanse
of burning sand and sat down on a boulder to try
and devise some means of crossing over.</p>

<p>“Can’t you think of anything?” snapped Ruggedo,
as Peter sat kicking his heels against the boulder.
“If this silly old cloak weren’t torn, I’d skim across
in no time. A skudge on those pesky pirates anyway!
Sa—ay?” Opening his eyes very wide, Ruggedo
thrust his face close to Peter’s. “What else was in
that casket?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Only a couple of onions and an emerald,” answered
Peter listlessly.</p>

<p>“Let’s see ’em!” Bounding off the boulder, the
Gnome King held out his hand. Peter produced the
strangely marked stone first.</p>

<p>“Command it to carry us across the desert,” advised
the Gnome King, after trying unsuccessfully to
decipher the markings on the sorcerer’s stone. So
Peter closed his eyes and commanded the emerald to
carry them across the desert. They waited for several
minutes, then, when nothing happened, Peter
opened the ivory box and showed Ruggedo the two
magic bulbs.</p>

<p>“In case of extreme danger, plant these.” Ruggedo
read these directions with a puzzled frown, then
snapping his fingers began to skip with excitement.
“Why don’t you plant ’em?” he squealed impatiently.
“Plant ’em, General! Plant ’em!”</p>

<p>“But we’re not in extreme danger,” objected Peter
reasonably enough.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_124" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_124.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“We’re not!” yelled Ruggedo, tugging at his beard.
“Why, boy, you don’t know what extreme danger is.
We have to cross that desert, don’t we? Well, just
put one foot on that sand and you’ll go up like a puff
of smoke. Don’t you call that extreme danger?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
Peter argued a while longer, then, as Ruggedo insisted
and there really seemed nothing else to do,
he scooped out two holes in the ground at his feet,
dropped in the magic roots and covered them with
mud and sand. Stepping back a few paces, they
waited eagerly for what would happen. First came
a sharp explosion. Then two great green plants burst
through the surface of the earth. They were about
three times the size of Peter and, as he watched, the
outer leaves opened downward, disclosing round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
plush seats within. Peter looked questioningly over
at Ruggedo, but the gnome, being more experienced
than Peter in magic, had jumped into one plant and
seated himself on the plush cushion. A little doubtfully,
Peter jumped into the other.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_125" style="max-width: 80.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_125.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Just like an elevator,” thought Peter, as the bulb
grew rapidly upward, shooting higher and higher on
its long, pliant stem. “But I don’t see what good
growing up will do,” he muttered, peering giddily
out between the green leaves. Whether he saw or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
not, the stem of the bulb continued to grow. Clouds
flew by with dazzling swiftness. Peter was all prepared
to bump his head on the ceiling of the sky when
the long stem began to arch downward. Suppose it
broke and dropped him on the burning sands of the
deadly desert! With a violent shudder, Peter closed
his eyes, and as he did, the stem with a final spurt
turned the strange elevator in which Peter was riding
completely upside down, and out fell the little
boy, heels over eyebrows.</p>

<p>Ruggedo had been served in the same manner but,
none the worse for their tumble, they picked themselves
up and began looking around. They had fallen
in a sunny peach orchard. In the distance they could
see the shimmering sand of the dangerous desert,
while not far away stood a small, yellow, dome-shaped
cottage.</p>

<p>“We’ll go there,” declared Ruggedo, tucking the
magic cloak more carefully under his arm. “We’ll
go there, General, and inquire the way to the Kingdom
of Patch. But remember to say nothing of the
plans to capture my belt. We’re in the enemy’s country
now!”</p>

<p>Still dazed from the surprising way in which they
had crossed the desert, Peter looked around him with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
delight. It did not look like the enemy’s country to
Peter and, picking up a large, luscious peach, he decided
then and there that he was going to like the
Marvelous Land of Oz.</p>

<p>Peter thought that even the Wizard of Oz, himself,
would be interested in the wonderful elevator plants,
and decided to tell him all about them when he got to
the Emerald City.</p>

Peter Meets Kuma Party</h2>


<p>As they walked up the neat pebble path to the little
yellow house, Peter tried to remember all he had
read about Oz and its curious inhabitants. But nothing
he had read prepared him for the next happening.
In answer to their knock, the door simply burst
open and out came a hand and foot without any body
at all. The hand seized Peter’s hand, shook it warmly
and drew him into the house. The foot gave Ruggedo
such a kick, he went flying into a gooseberry bush.
Drawn by the hand into a cozy sitting room, Peter
stood trembling with uneasiness. In a comfortable
chair, smoking a pipe, sat the owner of the cottage,
also the owner of the hand and foot, and Peter gave
a gasp as they immediately snapped back to their
proper places.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed,” said the stranger in a soft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
voice and, taking the pipe out of his mouth, he smiled
kindly at the little boy. Peter was not alarmed—he
was perfectly petrified and, as the old gentleman’s
head flew off his body and looked out the window,
he dropped into a chair and began to fan himself
with his cap. “I thought he’d go away,” sighed the
head regretfully, “but he’s coming into the house.
Why do you travel with a bad little creature like
that?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_130" style="max-width: 79.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_130.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Because I’m lost,” explained Peter, in a slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
shaky voice, turning around to address himself to
the head.</p>

<p>“Well, you may find yourself in a heap of trouble,
travelling with a gnome. Never trust a gnome,” advised
the head, coming back to settle on the old gentleman’s
shoulders. “Ah! Here he comes!”</p>

<p>“Who kicked me?” demanded Ruggedo, glaring all
around in a perfect fury. The owner of the cottage
made no reply, but as he needed more tobacco for his
pipe just then flung out his hand toward the mantel.
The hand sailed through the air like a bird and, seizing
the tobacco pouch, set it on the table and then
quietly attached itself to the man’s wrist. At this odd
occurrence, Ruggedo’s eyes rolled wildly. Cringing
against the wall, he began to move stealthily toward
the door.</p>

<p>“Don’t go,” begged the owner of the cottage
blandly. “I’m not especially fond of gnomes, but as
you are with this honest lad you may stay. Sit down
on that bench there and if I catch you stealing anything,
I’ll throw my head at you.” Pale with terror,
Ruggedo did as he was told, while the man’s hand,
flying off again, closed and locked the door.</p>

<p>“There!” he sighed, leaning back contentedly,
“now we can talk without being disturbed and let us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
start at once with names. My name,” he confided
proudly, “is Kuma Party, and I have had the curious
gift which seems so to astonish you since early childhood.
My father was a wizard, practicing magic in
the Zamagoochie Country, before the practice of
magic was forbidden in Oz, and it is to my father that
I attribute my strange come-apartishness.” He
paused and waited politely for Peter to make some
remark, but Peter by this time was simply speechless,
so Kuma, with an indulgent smile, went quietly
on with his story.</p>

<p>“Being constructed as I am is extremely convenient,”
he explained earnestly. “I am never tired or
rushed about as ordinary Oz folk are. If I wish to
pick the peaches in my orchard, I send my hands to
attend to the matter and while they are busily at
work I rest myself comfortably at home. If my body
is tired and I desire to be amused, I send my head to
the nearest village for news and I can often help my
less fortunate neighbors by lending them a hand or
foot when they are in trouble. Perhaps I can help
you?” he suggested, leaning amiably toward Peter.
“May I lend you a hand?” he finished graciously.</p>

<p>Now Kuma, in spite of his come-apartishness,
seemed so pleasant and jolly that Peter wanted to tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
him the whole history of his adventures, but Ruggedo
frowned and shook his head, so for the present Peter
decided to fall in with the gnome’s plans and merely
told Kuma his name and asked him the way to Patch.</p>

<p>“Patch?” mused the Winkie thoughtfully. “Why,
that’s not far from here. It is just below the Kingdom
of Queen Ann of Oogaboo, but why not wait till
morning? It’s growing dark now and besides it’s
raining.” Looking out in surprise, Peter saw that it
was raining. He had been so interested in Kuma’s
story that he had not even heard the patter of raindrops
on the roof.</p>

<p>“Better stay,” urged Kuma hospitably. “While my
hands are preparing the supper, you can tell me some
more about your own self and why you are going to
Patch.”</p>

<p>All during Kuma’s conversation, Ruggedo had
been wiggling with impatience and now, bouncing
to his feet, he motioned for Peter to come along.</p>

<p>“I guess we will have to go,” sighed Peter. “Which
direction do we take from here, Mr. Party?” The
old Winkie looked disapprovingly at the little gnome,
then shaking his head and evidently concluding that
it was no affair of his, threw out his right arm. It
immediately whizzed up stairs, but was back in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
moment, a large umbrella hanging in the crook of
the elbow and a lantern grasped in the hand.</p>

<p>“Since you must go,” said Kuma, rising slowly to
his feet, “at least let me point out the way for you
and loan you an umbrella.”</p>

<p>“It’s very kind of you,” faltered Peter, ducking in
spite of himself as the arm passed over his head on
its way to open the door. “Are you sure you can
spare it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” Kuma nodded cheerfully. “I still have
one left, you know, and as I’m only going to play
checkers this evening, one will be plenty. Goodbye.”
He smiled, patting Peter kindly on the shoulder. “Remember
what I told you about gnomes.” He stared
sternly down at Ruggedo, and Ruggedo, not daring
to meet his eye, scuttled nervously into the garden.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll see you again,” said Peter, and shaking
Kuma’s remaining hand stepped reluctantly after the
Gnome King.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” called Kuma and, with a farewell wave
and nod he went in and shut the door. Peter had to
run to catch up with Ruggedo. He was already out
of the gate and halfway down the road. As he
reached the gnome’s side, Kuma’s arm, holding the
umbrella carefully, took its position over their heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“Why didn’t you stay?” grumbled Peter crossly.
“There were lots of things I wanted to ask that man.”
Really he felt quite provoked with the old gnome.</p>

<p>“Sh-h!” warned Ruggedo, pointing warningly up
at the arm over their heads. “Shh-hh!”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t suppose he can hear through his
fingers, do you?” teased Peter, and then, because everything
did seem so comical and ridiculous, he burst
into a loud laugh. “I wish grandfather could see
this,” gasped the Captain of the A. P. Baseball Team,
reaching in his pocket for his handkerchief. “Jimminy,
wouldn’t it be fine to have an extra arm in a
scrap with the fellows!”</p>

<p>Ruggedo was too busy with his own thoughts to
pay any attention to Peter’s, so for quite a while they
walked along in silence. It was pouring steadily, but
Kuma’s umbrella was so large and his hand held it
so carefully, not a drop fell upon the travelers. It
was too gloomy to see much of the country but, from
the tidy farms and orchards they did glimpse through
the curtain of rain, Peter concluded that the Winkie
Country must be a very prosperous and delightful
place to live in. They had to walk briskly to keep
pace with the umbrella, but after an hour or so the
rain stopped. The arm stopped also, and after standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
about uncertainly and wondering what to do,
Peter reached up and closed the umbrella. Then
taking a match, which he noticed in the rim of the
lantern that swung from Kuma’s wrist, he lifted the
chimney and lit the wick within. This was evidently
what the arm had been waiting for and now it moved
confidently a few paces ahead, the forefinger of its
hand pointing stiffly in the direction they were to
follow. It was quite late by now and the lantern
shed a cheery light over the fast darkening road.</p>

<p>Nibbling at the supper Kaliko had packed up for
them, Peter and Ruggedo hastened after Kuma’s
guiding hand.</p>

<p>“I wonder if it will fly back when we come to
Patch,” mused Peter as they turned off the main
road and into a small wood.</p>

<p>“Let’s hold on to it,” whispered the Gnome King
craftily. “We can tie it up somehow and then when
I get my magic belt, I’ll make it work for me.”</p>

<p>“That’s a nice way to repay a man for helping us,”
said Peter angrily. “You ought to be ashamed of
yourself.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not,” grunted the Gnome King, pausing
to light his pipe, “and if you are going to be general
of my armies, you’d better get over these nice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
ideas and notions. Didn’t I hear you say a while ago
that you’d like to have an extra arm yourself?”</p>

<p>“I said I’d like to have one, but I never said I’d
steal one,” answered Peter indignantly.</p>

<p>“Take anything you need,” advised Ruggedo, puffing
away at his pipe. “That’s my motto.” Realizing
it was useless to argue with so bad a little gnome,
Peter kept his own counsel and, fixing his eyes on
the bobbing lantern ahead, wondered when they
would reach Patch and what it would be like when
they did reach it. He hoped there would be no wild
animals or bandits upon the road and peered anxiously
from side to side as they made their way
through the tangled woodland. But without any
worse mishap than a tumble over a fallen tree trunk,
they came to the end of the wood and struck out
across a broad field.</p>

<p>“Tomatoes!” muttered Peter, treading carefully
between the plants. Leaning down he picked an especially
tempting one and sank his teeth deep into the
side. “Ugh!” choked Peter, shuddering with distaste.
“It’s cotton! What kind of a silly country is this
anyway?”</p>

<p>“A cotton country, I s’pose,” grinned Ruggedo,
greatly amused at Peter’s wry face. “Cotton? Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
maybe it’s Patch itself!” By the light of Kuma’s
lantern, they could now see some cottages ahead and
the dim outline of a castle.</p>

<p>“Rocks and Rookies!” exulted the Gnome King,
waving the cloak over his head. “It won’t be long
now before I’m ruler of the realm, boy!”</p>

<p>“I thought you just wanted your magic belt,”
puffed Peter, running anxiously after Ruggedo.</p>

<p>“Oh, grow up!” called the gnome scornfully over
his shoulder. “Grow up and don’t be so soft. You’re
a regular Wooshmacushion!” Shooting ahead like
an arrow, Kuma’s arm now flew so swiftly that it
was all they could do to keep up with it. By the time
they had reached the castle they had barely enough
breath to mount the steps. As they did, the arm, in
a business-like manner, set down the lantern and,
taking the umbrella in its hand, thumped hard upon
the castle door.</p>

<p>“Good!” panted Ruggedo, sinking down on the top
step. “That ought to rouse them.” When no response
came, he jumped up himself and began to kick
and pound on the panels. Peter, naturally more
polite, had at once put his finger on the bell and they
were thus engaged when Piecer and Scrapper, returning
from town, turned in at the gate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“Customers,” murmured Scrapper, rubbing his
hands in anticipation.</p>

<p>“Wizards!” faltered Piecer, pointing with a trembling
finger to the detached arm of Kuma, still beating
on the door with the umbrella.</p>

<p>“So much the better! So much the better! Wizards
always pay well.” Running up the palace steps, the
Chief Scrapper of Patch tapped Ruggedo respectfully
on the shoulder. “What can we do for you?”
asked Scrapper, pulling the castle key from his
pocket.</p>

<p>Ruggedo had been expecting attention from the
other side of the door and was so startled that he
made no answer, but the hand of Kuma immediately
dropped the umbrella and shook hands with the
Quilty statesman. It then moved quickly on toward
Piecer, but Piecer, with a muffled scream, dodged behind
a pillar. Snapping its fingers to show that it did
not care one way or the other, the hand approached
Peter and, after patting him approvingly on the
shoulder, slipped a small note into his pocket. Then
it shook its finger sternly under Ruggedo’s nose,
picked up the lantern and umbrella and vanished
from view.</p>

<p>Even Scrapper was somewhat dashed at this and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
in a slightly choky voice, repeated his question to
Ruggedo. Ruggedo was terribly provoked to have
the arm escape but, recovering himself quickly,
bowed civilly to the two Quilties.</p>

<p>“I have a cloak to be mended,” he announced
grandly, “and will pay you handsomely for the
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Certainly! Certainly!” Unlocking the door, Scrapper
waved them into the shabby hallway then, lighting
a candle, bade them follow him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll take you to the Queen,” said Scrapper importantly,
“and while she is entertaining you I will fetch
our most skillful needlewoman.”</p>

<p>As for Peter, he was so excited over the adventure
with Kuma’s hand, he could think of nothing else.</p>

Queen Scraps Meets Peter</h2>


<p>It is hard to say who was more astonished, when
Scrapper opened the door of the sitting room and
ushered in Peter and Ruggedo. The Patchwork Girl,
who had been expecting a rescue party headed by
the Scarecrow or some of her other old friends, stared
in disbelief and horror at the King of the Gnomes.
Ruggedo was so surprised to see Scraps outside of
the Emerald City, and so disconcerted to know that
she was the Queen on whom he must depend for
favor, that he nearly ran out of the room. Scraps
knew all about the wicked little gnome, and had even
been present when he was banished to Runaway
Island. Peter thought of all the curious people he
had met so far, and this Queen was the most curious
and comical. But as they all kept their thoughts to
themselves, Scrapper noticed nothing amiss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“Kindly entertain this customer until I return,”
ordered Scrapper and, with a curt nod at the Queen,
went out and locked the door behind him. For a
second longer Scraps and the Gnome King stared
fixedly at one another. Then the Patchwork Girl,
snatching off her steel-rimmed spectacles, groaned:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ruggedo, as I live, Oh my land!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How’d he get off of that island?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“That’s my affair,” answered the Gnome King in a
surly voice. “How do you happen to be Queen of
Patch, I should like to know?”</p>

<p>“That’s my affair,” sniffed Scraps haughtily. “But
I know you are up to some mischief. Boy,” she demanded,
turning severely to Peter, “where did you
meet this robber and what is he planning to do?”</p>

<p>Peter shuffled his feet uncomfortably, hardly
knowing what to say. He was anxious for the magic
cloak to be mended, for how else was he to reach the
Emerald City and warn Ozma of her danger. If he
told the whole truth they might both be thrown into
prison, or so thought Peter then. Ruggedo was waiting
nervously for his reply, and as the little boy mumbled
out a few words about being lost and trying to
find his way back home, the Gnome King sighed
with relief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“Why get so excited?” wheezed Ruggedo in a conciliatory
voice. “I merely want to have my cloak
mended and was told it could be done here better
than anywhere else. What’s wrong about that?”</p>

<p>“It’s wrong for you to be off the island,” insisted
Scraps. “You know perfectly well you were banished
forever. Oh, for an egg! For a dozen eggs!” At
the mention of eggs, Ruggedo turned quite pale under
his wrinkled grey skin and, as Peter looked at
the two in perplexity, Scrapper returned bringing
an old Quilty grandame with him. She was angry
to be summoned at so late an hour and, grumbling
crossly, snatched the cloak from Ruggedo’s hand.
Seating herself in a low chair by the candle, she
opened her sewing box and began to stitch so rapidly
that her needle fairly flashed through the air.</p>

<p>“Now then,” murmured Scrapper, smiling in satisfaction,
“as to the price?”</p>

<p>“I command you to arrest this creature,” interrupted
the Patchwork Girl, rushing up to the Chief
Scrapper. “Don’t you realize that he is the former
King of the Gnomes and that he has tried to capture
Oz at least a dozen times?”</p>

<p>“A king?” exclaimed Scrapper, clasping his hands
rapturously. “Why, how we are honored! Have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
chair, your Majesty! Have a cushion! Have—”</p>

<p>“Oh, have some sense!” screamed Scraps, while
Ruggedo sidled closer to the old woman who was
mending his cloak. “If you let him go he’ll try to
capture the Emerald City. He always does.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“He’s mean, he’s cruel, he’s dangerous,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He’ll ruin Oz and all of us!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Nonsense!” sniffed Scrapper, giving the Patchwork
Girl a push. “He is our honored customer, and
you may be the Queen here, but remember, I’m the
boss. Keep quiet or I’ll send for the Scissor Bird.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t this make your ear ache?” Peter
jumped at the new voice and, peering around in the
direction it had come from, saw a little bear peeking
out of a chest. It was Grumpy, of course, and, as
Peter continued to stare at him, he retired into the
chest and closed the lid. But the Gnome King, encouraged
by Scrapper’s treatment of the Patchwork
Girl, puffed out his cheeks quite cheerfully.</p>

<p>“You are a man of judgment,” he observed in a
flattering tone. “Be assured that I will remember
this kindness, but what can I do to repay you for
mending the cloak?” Scrapper looked thoughtful
for a moment while the Patchwork Girl continued to
mutter and scold under her breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“Is this your slave?” he inquired at last, turning
inquisitively to Peter. Ruggedo seemed a little surprised,
but to Peter’s disgust and astonishment immediately
nodded briskly.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Scrapper, “suppose you give us
the boy in payment for mending the cloak. Our
Queen is not quick enough to do all the work here
and he looks strong and willing.”</p>

<p>“I’m not his slave!” burst out Peter wrathfully.
“I’ll not stay here, you old simpleton.” But the more
he shouted the more Ruggedo nodded and smiled at
Scrapper.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” whispered the Patchwork Girl, as
Peter, on his way to the door, bumped into her,
“never mind, I’ll help you.” And with this assurance
he was forced to be satisfied. Realizing that Ruggedo
meant to keep none of his promises, Peter tried
to plan a way to get hold of the cloak first. But the
Gnome King, pressing close to the old Quilty seamstress,
waved him jealously away, and Scrapper, jerking
him roughly by the arm, whirled him off into a
corner.</p>

<p>And now the cloak was mended. Shaking the
threads from its folds the old grandame held it out
to Ruggedo. As she did so, Peter rushed forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
impetuously, but the gnome was too quick for him.
Flinging on the magic garment, Ruggedo vanished
from view, only the blue patch on the back of the
cloak showing he was still in the room. Scrapper
and the others screamed out in alarm, but Peter,
throwing up his arm, cried out loudly, “Take him to
Zamagoochie!” In a flash the Gnome King was gone,
at least the blue patch was gone, and Peter, stamping
his foot angrily, turned to the foolish old Quilty.
“Now you’ve done it!” panted the little boy.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_148" style="max-width: 63.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_148.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“I told you not to help him,” cried Scraps, coming
over to stand beside Peter. “You’ll be sorry for
this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, keep quiet!” mumbled Scrapper, mopping his
forehead with his patched hanky. To tell the truth,
the sudden disappearance of the Gnome King had
upset him terribly. “I don’t see what you’re fussing
about,” he finished fretfully. “Here you have a nice
new slave to work for you. Out of my way there!”</p>

<p>Taking the old Quilty woman by the arm, he
brushed rudely past Peter, unlocked the door and
went out. As the key clicked in the lock, Peter sank
down on the floor, the picture of discouragement.</p>

<p>“Why did you say that about Zamagoochie?” asked
Scraps, dropping down beside the little boy and regarding
him curiously.</p>

<p>“Because it was the first place that came into my
head,” explained Peter. “Jimminy, but I hope it’s
a long way from the Emerald City, and I hope something
happens to keep him there.”</p>

<p>“Will the cloak take him anywhere he wants to
go?” demanded Scraps. Peter nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>“Then good-bye to the Emerald City and Ozma!”
moaned Scraps. “Good-bye to all of us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what’s to be done with the slave?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
Grumpy had lifted the lid of the chest again and was
regarding Peter with great interest.</p>

<p>“He’s not a slave!” exclaimed Scraps scornfully.
“I can tell by his looks, he’s a mortal child like Dorothy
and Betsy. How did you find your way to Oz,
boy?” Peter was anxious to escape from the castle,
but when Scraps assured him that there was no present
hope of such a thing, he told her all that had
happened since the balloon bird carried him off from
Philadelphia. As the story progressed, Grumpy
climbed out of the chest and sat as close to Peter as
he could possibly squeeze.</p>

<p>“Tell him about us!” urged the little bear, as Peter
wound up his story with a description of Kuma Party
and his guiding hand. Scraps shook her head impatiently,
but when Peter added his voice to Grumpy’s
she introduced the pet of the former Queen and
gave a brief description of herself and her happy life
at the capital. When Peter heard how she had been
kidnapped and forced to do all the castle work, he
shook his head sympathetically.</p>

<p>“We’ll both run away,” declared Peter, resolutely,
“and as you know more about Oz than I do, perhaps
we’ll reach the Emerald City ahead of Ruggedo.”</p>

<p>“But first you must escape from the castle,” the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
little bear reminded them sagely. “How will you do
that?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp93" id="i_151" style="max-width: 63.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_151.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“I wish there had been a little more magic in that
casket,” sighed Scraps. “All you have left is the
emerald. Let me see the emerald, Peter.” Peter
pulled out the sorcerer’s stone and handed it over to
Scraps and, as he did, felt the note that Kuma’s hand
had thrust into his pocket. Opening it eagerly, Peter
followed the Patchwork Girl to the light. But as
they reached the center table, the candle which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
been burning lower and lower gave a final sputter
and went out, leaving them in total darkness.</p>

<p>“Botheration!” cried Peter in exasperation. “Now
what shall we do?”</p>

<p>“Go to sleep,” yawned the little bear. “Whenever
you don’t know what to do, go to sleep. That’s my
advice. Here, lean on me.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_152" style="max-width: 62.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_152.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Why don’t you?” suggested Scraps, feeling her
way carefully back to the rocker. “Mortal folk need
rest, but as I do not, I’ll sit and plan our escape.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>Grumpy’s advice did seem sensible and, as Peter
was very tired, he curled down beside the little bear
and soon did go to sleep, his head resting comfortably
on Grumpy’s soft shoulder. In his hand he
grasped Kuma’s note, and in his dreams imagined
himself already in the Emerald City, fighting to defend
the little Queen of all Oz.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_10">CHAPTER 10<br>
Escape From Patch At Last</h2>


<p>When Peter awakened next morning, he thought
for a few moments he was still aboard ship.
But he soon realized that the up and down motion he
was experiencing was merely the deep breathing of
the little bear. Without disturbing Grumpy, he
straightened up and rubbed his eyes. Scraps was
over by the window turning Soob’s emerald over and
over in her cotton fingers. Reminded of the letter
he had been about to read when the candle went out,
Peter felt around till he found Kuma’s note. Hurrying
over to the Patchwork Girl, he spread it open and
quickly read its contents.</p>

<p>“If you ever need a helping hand, send for mine,”
said the note. “Write directions on this paper and
toss into the air.”</p>

<p>“Well, hurrah!” exclaimed Peter, showing the note<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
to Scraps. “Kuma will lend us a hand any time we
need it.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Three cheers! Four laughs!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Five grins—a bow!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Send for it quick, I need it now,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>cried the Patchwork Girl. “In a minute I’ll have to
cook, sweep, dust, scrub and make beds. Why, an
extra hand will be wonderful. Send for it, Peter.
Send for it right way. You’re a slave too, remember.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking it might unlock the doors and
help us escape,” mused the little boy, wrinkling up
his brows. “Could you read the markings on the
emerald?”</p>

<p>“No,” admitted Scraps, handing back the stone,
“but keep it safely, Peter. You never know when or
where magic will work in this country and we need
all the magic we can find to get to the Emerald City
before Ruggedo.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where he is now?” worried Peter. “Zamagoochie
was the country Kuma’s father came from,
but I wonder where it is and whether Rug is still
there or whether he has reached the Emerald City
and turned Ozma to a canary?”</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop!” begged Scraps. “Let’s stop worrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
and try to think. If we send for Kuma’s hand
now, when all the Quilties are working in the fields,
we will soon be captured, even if we escape from the
castle. We’ll have to wait till night,” sighed the
Patchwork Girl, “though how I’m going to stand another
day here I don’t see!”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Peter sympathetically, “I’ll
help.”</p>

<p>“I’ll help, too!” volunteered Grumpy, rolling over
on his side and yawning tremendously. “It won’t be
as bad as growling all the time and that’s how I
helped Cross Patch!”</p>

<p>“Sh-hh!” warned Scraps, “Here they come! Look
out for the Scissor Bird, Peter, he’s dreadfully careless
with his bill.” Thrusting Kuma’s note into his
pocket and assuming as defiant an attitude as he
well could, Peter waited for the door to open, which
it presently did. In came Scrapper, the Scissor Bird
on his shoulder and Piecer staggering under a great
pile of coats and other garments that had been sent
in to be mended.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Slave!” Scrapper bowed stiffly to
Peter and then to Scraps. “Kindly prepare breakfast,
at once!”</p>

<p>“Oh scrapple!” scolded the Patchwork Girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“Not scrapple, eggs,” said Piecer, setting down his
pile of garments. “And when you have finished with
breakfast, please sort these.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_158" style="max-width: 99.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_158.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Why don’t you sort them yourself,” suggested
Peter boldly, but as the Scissor Bird made a dash in
his direction he hastily sprang behind Scraps.</p>

<p>“It’s an outrage to expect a Queen to do all the
work,” began Scraps, settling her spectacles severely.
“Ozma never does a stroke of work. Ozma—”</p>

<p>“Ozma?” shrilled the Scissor Bird. “Well, every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
time you think you’re Ozma, look in the glass. Come
along, you lazy creature!” Circling over the Patchwork
Girl’s head and making playful snips at her
yarn, the Scissor Bird drove her ahead of him
toward the castle kitchen. Peter and Grumpy followed
cautiously, conversing in indignant whispers.</p>

<p>Peter had often been camping and, seeing how terribly
unhandy Scraps was with the cooking utensils,
he prepared the breakfast himself. Then he set the
table and carried the eggs, nicely fried, to the two
Quilties, who sat at ease in the shabby dining room.
The Scissor Bird ate a saucer of calico scraps and
Grumpy a loaf of bread and an apple. After being
assured that the Patchwork Girl herself would eat
nothing, Peter fried himself an egg and sat down at
the kitchen table to enjoy himself. The Scissor Bird
was too busy eating to bother them for a moment and,
availing himself of this opportunity, Peter began to
talk in a low voice to Scraps.</p>

<p>“Why did you wish for a dozen eggs when you
first saw Ruggedo?” he asked curiously.</p>

<p>“Because eggs are poison to gnomes,” whispered
Scraps. “They are more afraid of eggs than of bombshells
and they cannot even stay in the same room
with one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“Hm-m!” mused Peter thoughtfully, “I’ll remember
that. How is it,” he asked presently, “that
Grumpy can talk?”</p>

<p>“All the animals in Oz talk,” explained Scraps in
a matter of fact voice. “Just wait till you hear the
Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger!”</p>

<p>“Do they live in the Emerald City?” Peter’s eyes
grew round with interest. Scraps nodded enthusiastically,
then noticing that the Scissor Bird had finished,
she sprang up and began to clear away the
dishes. But Grumpy kindly offered to wash them,
so hurrying back into the sitting room, Scraps and
Peter fell to sorting old clothes. In one pile they
put coats, in another dresses, in a third, trousers, and
in a fourth, all the shirts needing new cuffs or collars.
Conversation was impossible, for the Scissor Bird was
never quiet for a moment and soon Peter’s head began
to ache from its continuous screeching. Once
when he dropped an old cloak, it snipped a lock of his
hair and when he struck out at it angrily, it nearly
nipped a piece off his ear.</p>

<p>To Scrapper and Piecer, sitting in the doorway,
this proved highly amusing and, glaring at the old
Quilties, Peter resolved to send for Kuma’s hand at
the first opportunity. Grumpy had finished the dishes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
and, with a gingham apron tied round his waist, was
energetically sweeping the floor.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_161" style="max-width: 79.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_161.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Don’t you care,” he whispered comfortingly as he
passed Peter. “To-day won’t last forever!” It seemed
like forever to Peter and Scraps, but as they came
to the bottom of the pile the Patchwork Girl made a
startling discovery. Between a faded vest and a
quilted dressing gown lay an old grey sack. As
Scraps held it up, she saw a note sticking out of the
pocket. The Scissor Bird happened at that moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
to be swinging on the chandelier so, snatching out
the note, Scraps read it quickly herself and then
passed it on to Peter.</p>

<p>“The Sandman’s Nap Sack. Will put wearer to
sleep at once,” read Peter. Then, as Scraps put her
finger warningly to her lips, he tucked the Nap Sack
beneath his coat.</p>

<p>“We’ll put ’em all to sleep,” whispered Peter out
of the corner of his mouth. “We’ll send for Kuma’s
hand and get away from here!” They soon had a
chance to try the Nap Sack, for Piecer and Scrapper,
having some work to attend to in the garden, went
out and locked the door in their usual manner.</p>

<p>Immediately Scraps threw down a pile of coats
and stood up defiantly.</p>

<p>“I refuse to work any longer,” she shouted, stamping
her foot emphatically.</p>

<p>“Hah!” snapped the Scissor Bird, falling off the
chandelier and stopping directly in front of Scraps’
nose. “Every time you open your mouth you say
something.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” answered Scraps saucily, “and every time
you say something you open your mouth.” As the
furious creature rushed at the Patchwork Girl, Peter
threw the Nap Sack over his head. No sooner had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
he done so than its shrill voice grew lower and lower,
until, with a tired flop, it fell to the floor and lay
snoring like a zazagooch, which is the loudest snoring
animal in Oz.</p>

<p>“We won’t wait till night. We’ll send the note
now, Scraps,” cried Peter triumphantly.</p>

<p>“What’s up? What’s up. Don’t leave me,” begged
the little bear, crowding close to Peter. “I’m tired of
being cross. I want to go some place where I can
be pleasant without losing my position.”</p>

<p>“All right! All right!” promised Peter. “But
you’ll have to help us, Grumpy. Now keep quiet
while I write to Kuma.” Pulling out the crumpled
letter, Peter found a pencil and scribbled on the bottom
of the page: “We are prisoners in the palace of
Patch. Please send us your hand to unlock the doors
and help us to escape.” Signing his name hurriedly,
Peter tossed the note into the air. It disappeared
almost at once and in high excitement the three sat
down to await developments. “I believe we could
take that Nap Sack off and use it again,” observed
Peter after a little silence.</p>

<p>“He might wake up,” objected Scraps.</p>

<p>“But we can easily put him to sleep again.” Tiptoeing
over to the Scissor Bird, he took off the Nap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
Sack. As he did there was a crash outside and, hurrying
to the window, they saw Kuma’s right arm and
hand smashing its way through the glass in the
castle door.</p>

<p>“Hurry! Hurry!” cried Scraps. Tearing the work
basket from her head she threw it into a corner and
flung the crown jewels of Patch after it. “I abdicate!”
chuckled the Patchwork Girl, turning expectantly
toward the door.</p>

<p>“Now then,” breathed Peter, “let’s all stand together
and run like sixty.”</p>

<p>“If we stand, how can we run?” mumbled Grumpy,
but no one answered the little bear, for at that instant
the key turned in the lock, the door opened and
in swept the arm of Kuma, a stout club grasped in
its hand. Motioning for them to follow, it whizzed
down the hallway. Scrapper, running in from the
garden to see what was happening, received a smart
blow on the head. Piecer, panting up the steps from
the kitchen, was picked up bodily and dropped out
of the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp54" id="i_165" style="max-width: 45.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_165.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Through the castle door, down the steps and out
of the garden rushed the three adventurers. As they
started down the road, a crowd of Quilty men, on
their way to the palace with a fresh load of patches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
stared at them in astonishment. Then, suddenly
realizing that the Queen was escaping, they rushed
after her with yells and shouts of disapproval. But
the arm of Kuma laid about with the club, seeming
to be everywhere at once, and with groans and
screams the Quilties fell back. Only three of the
bolder ones continued the chase. Over the most persistent
of their pursuers Peter flung the Nap Sack
and, as he fell snoring by the roadside, Grumpy sent
the second flying into a ditch. Kuma’s club soon disposed
of the third and without further interruption
they pelted down the crossroads of Patch.</p>

<p>Always Kuma’s hand flashed on ahead, making the
way easy, taking down fence bars, opening gates,
thrusting aside the branches of trees. Many of the
Quilties saw them from the cottage windows, but
before they could get down to their doors the strange
procession had passed by. Scraps, being magically
made and stuffed with cotton, did not tire, but
Grumpy and Peter were soon panting with exhaustion.
There was a remedy for even this, however.
Throwing down the club, Kuma’s arm jerked first
one and then the other into the air, carrying them by
turns to the very edge of the little Kingdom.</p>

<p>In a small maple grove, several miles from Patch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
they stopped to rest. Peter still had hold of Kuma’s
hand and would have liked to keep it longer, but
gently disengaging itself, it patted him kindly on
the shoulder, shook hands with Scraps and was gone.
This time it left no note and regretfully they watched
it soar over the tree tops and disappear from view.</p>

<p>“Well,” gasped Peter, leaning back against a tree,
“we’re out of Patch and where do we go now,
Scraps?”</p>

</div>

<p>answered the Patchwork Girl cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope we do,” puffed Peter, taking a long
breath. “Come on, let’s start, I’m rested.”</p>

<p>“Do you realize that the Kingdom of Patch will
go to pieces in four days without you?” grunted the
little bear, pattering along beside Scraps.</p>

<p>“Let it!” cried Scraps, recklessly turning a cartwheel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_11">CHAPTER 11<br>
Scraps Meets Sultan Of Suds</h2>


<p>Walking slowly at first, and then more briskly,
Peter and his companions hurried on in the
direction Scraps had pointed out. Grumpy was very
helpful, for whenever they were in doubt, the little
bear would climb a tree and, after looking all around,
would guide them to the best and widest of the roads
that ran hither and thither through the pleasant land
of the Winkies. After his last climb, Grumpy had
reported a village ahead and, quite cheerfully, they
trudged along under the banana trees that edged the
roadway.</p>

<p>“Even if Ruggedo has reached the Emerald City,”
remarked Scraps, waving to a Winkie farmer at
work in the fields, “we’ll find some way to capture
him. Our wizard is very clever, boys. Perhaps he
has captured him already!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“But with the magic cloak, Ruggedo will be invisible,”
answered Peter gravely, “all but the patch,
and no one will know that he is there. I hope he’s
still in Zamagoochie. Do you think Ozma will be
able to send me back to Philadelphia, Scraps?”</p>

<p>“Of course!” chuckled the Patchwork Girl, skipping
at the mere mention of the little Queen. “Ozma
can do anything.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope she sends me back in time for the
game,” sighed Peter. “It’s only three days off and
I’m pitcher. And I wish I could take Grumpy back
for a mascot. Would you like to be our mascot,
Grumpy?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t sound safe,” mumbled Grumpy, wiggling
his nose very fast. “What is a mascot, Peter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a kind of pet to bring one luck,” explained
the little boy. “You could come to all the games and
have all the cake and peanuts you wanted.” Grumpy
considered the matter for a few moments, then, dropping
on all fours, shook his head.</p>

<p>“I belong to Scraps,” he announced, looking up admiringly
at the Patchwork Girl. “I’m her pet. Besides,
I’ll never leave Oz.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Peter in surprise.</p>

<p>“Oh, because—” Rearing up on his hind legs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Grumpy waved his paw solemnly. “In your country,
Peter, I could only be a bear, but in Oz, I’m a bear
and a person, too. That’s why it’s more fun to be
an animal in Oz than a person. Look at me,” he exclaimed
complacently. “I can do everything a boy
can do and everything a bear can do, so, of course, I
have twice as much fun! Can you do this, for instance?”
Drawing himself up into a ball, Grumpy
started rolling down a grassy slope at the side of
the road.</p>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Scraps, running after Grumpy,
“he has you there, Peter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we shouldn’t have turned off the road,”
objected Peter, hurrying after the Patchwork Girl.
“Stop! Scraps, stop!”</p>

<p>From a gentle slope, the hillside dropped suddenly
downward and now none of them could stop. Faster
and faster rolled Grumpy, faster and faster ran
Scraps and Peter, catching at trees and bushes to
keep from falling. Instead of grass, the ground beneath
their feet grew smooth and slippery as ice and
from an incline the hill turned to a regular mountain
side. It reminded Peter of the time he had tried skiing
and, after several frantic attempts to keep his
balance, he fell flat on his face and finished the slide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
on his stomach. Scraps, too, after a few wild spins
and flourishes, sat down hard and, in a state of
breathless surprise, they reached the foot of the
mountain. Grumpy had travelled most of the way
on his ear and was growling terribly in his own language.
He was covered with a fine yellow powder
and, as Scraps and Peter slid past, he began to lick
his fur furiously. But one taste was enough.</p>

<p>“Soap!” coughed the little bear, wrinkling up his
nose. “Yellow soap, too!”</p>

<p>“No wonder it was so slippery,” said Peter slowly.
“Now how are we going to climb up again?”</p>

<p>“We’re not!” announced Scraps, rising to her feet
with great difficulty. “Might as well try to walk up
a looking glass. Why, what funny trees!”</p>

<p>“They’re rubber,” announced Grumpy, giving himself
a shake, “and every branch is a spray.”</p>

<p>“A bath spray,” marveled Peter, staring up at the
snakelike mass of tubes overhead. They had landed
directly under one of the rubber trees and, as Peter
spoke, from every spray a perfect shower of warm
water sprinkled down upon them. Covered with
soap from their slide down the mountain, they were
soon in a fine lather, especially the little bear. When
they tried to dash out from under the rubber tree,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
they immediately slipped and fell, for the ground was
green soap and even more slippery than Soap Mountain.
Spluttering with surprise and shock, they
finally crawled on their hands and knees out of the
tree’s range.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_173" style="max-width: 61.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_173.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Water!” groaned Scraps dolefully.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Water makes my spirits sink,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It’s very bad for me, I think,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I know I’ll fade, perhaps I’ll shrink.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Don’t shrink,” begged Peter in alarm. “Shake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
yourself, old girl.” Balancing herself with difficulty,
the Patchwork Girl began shaking herself vigorously
and wringing out her skirts, while Peter, rubbing the
soap from his own eyes, saw that they were in a
strange and amazing village, where everything was
soap. The houses were built of small, square cakes
and the walks laid out in large blocks of green soap.
Turkish towel trees edged all the avenues and, stepping
cautiously to the nearest one, Peter picked a
towel and wiped his dripping face. Grumpy soon
followed his example. Then both went to help Scraps,
who was feeling both damp and discouraged. They
were fanning her briskly with dry towels, when a
procession of villagers came skating down the main
street.</p>

<p>“So that’s how they manage it,” whistled Peter,
taking a few skating steps himself to see how it was
done.</p>

<p>“More soap?” grumbled Grumpy. “Let’s run!”</p>

<p>“No, let’s wait and see what they have to say,”
whispered Peter.</p>

<p>The villagers were quite close by this time and
Peter was amazed to see that they also were entirely
made of soap. They wore turbans and robes of turkish
toweling and, with their arms tucked comfortably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
in their flowing sleeves, came skating toward
the travellers. Some of them were pink, some green,
some white and others violet, and they were all about
the size of ten-year-old children.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said Peter politely, as the first soapman
came to an abrupt stop before him. “How do you
do?”</p>

<p>“As I please, mostly,” retorted the soapman
shortly, “but I’m afraid you won’t do at all. Who
cut you out, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Oh, fall down!” advised Grumpy, picking up his
towel and beginning to fan Scraps again. “Fall
down, why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” sniffed the Patchwork Girl, wringing
her hands. They were still full of water.</p>

<p>“We are Suds,” answered the villager proudly.
“But we will have to take you to the Sultan. Are you
hard or soft?” he asked, turning again to Peter.</p>

<p>“Hard!” cried the little boy, stamping his foot defiantly.
He regretted this action almost immediately,
for his heel, slipping on the soap sidewalk,
threw him down on the back of his head. At this
the Suds simply bubbled over with amusement and
scorn. Then one Sud seized him by the left arm,
another by the right, and started skating down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
street. Looking over his shoulder, he saw that Scraps
and Grumpy were being treated in the same sudden
fashion. But soon he grew so interested in his surroundings
that he almost forgot his indignation.
The cottages of smooth green and pink soap were
really charming. The gardens were full of soap-bubble
bushes and vines and the bubbles, with their
shining colors, sparkled and shimmered in the sunshine.
Fountains of perfume filled the air with
fragrance and, besides the turkish towel and rubber
trees, there were bushes covered with snowy powder
puffs. As they reached the stately green soap palace
it began to snow and, catching one of the flakes on
the back of his hand, Peter discovered it was a soap
flake. Hurrying them through the soap stone gates,
the Suds pounded upon the castle door. It was immediately
opened by a tar soap slave in a yellow robe
and turban.</p>

<p>“Take these interlopers to Shampoozle,” said the
Sud who had first spoken to Peter.</p>

<p>“Whoozle?” gasped the Patchwork Girl, shaking
the soap flakes from her hair. No one deigned to answer
her question, but at the Sud’s command two
more slaves appeared and, bowing out the villagers,
closed the castle door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Follow me, interlopers,” said the slave and, skimming
expertly over the polished soap floor, he started
down the royal hallway.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_177" style="max-width: 58.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_177.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“I suppose we might as well,” giggled Peter and,
taking Grumpy’s paw, began sliding after the slave.
The two other slaves slid gravely behind and, as they
reached two royal purple soap doors, the first slave
threw up his arm and cried impressively:</p>

<p>“Give three salaams for the Sultan of Suds!” and,
jerking open the door, he fell flat upon his nose. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
was so unexpected that Peter and Grumpy lost their
balance and salaamed in spite of themselves, but the
Patchwork Girl slid defiantly up to the throne itself.</p>

<p>“I don’t give three slams for anyone!” announced
Scraps, snapping her fingers under Shampoozle’s
nose. “Show us the way out of here.”</p>

<p>“What!” snorted the Sultan, rising shakily from
his throne. “You refuse to salaam? Caka! Bara!”
He clapped his hands sharply. “Salaam her!” At
his command, the two slaves behind Scraps seized
her arms and, forcing her downward, touched her
cotton nose to the floor three times.</p>

<p>While Scraps was still choking and spluttering with
rage, Peter and Grumpy regained their footing and
stared curiously at Shampoozle. He was sitting on
an ivory soap throne with red sponge cushions. He
seemed to be made of green soap and his towel turban
was twice as high as the turbans of the other
Suds.</p>

<p>“That will teach you how to treat a Sultan,” sniffed
Shampoozle, shaking a finger severely at the Patchwork
Girl.</p>

<p>“Sultan!” cried Scraps, giving Caka and Bara each
a push. “You’re not a Sultan, you’re an Insultan.”</p>

<p>Shampoozle’s eyes grew round with displeasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
and Peter and Grumpy had some difficulty to conceal
their mirth.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_179" style="max-width: 62.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_179.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“There, there!” said the Sultan testily, “don’t be
impertinent. Kindly answer my questions, so I can
put you in your proper places. What kind of soap
are you made of, hard or soft, laundry or tub—are
you floaters or sinkers?”</p>

<p>“We’re not soap at all,” declared Peter indignantly.
“I should think—”</p>

<p>“Tut! Tut!” interrupted Shampoozle loftily, “I <i>am</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
thinking. Don’t talk so fast, we’ll soon make good
soap of you. Why, we can make soap of anything,
even rubbish,” he finished proudly. “Caka! Bara!
Just see how they lather.”</p>

<p>Before Peter or the others had time to object, the
two slaves, with three wet sponges, were rubbing
vigorously at their cheeks.</p>

<p>“No lather at all,” sighed Shampoozle in evident
disappointment. “Never mind, I’ll use you somehow.
That creature,” he pointed contemptuously at
Grumpy, “that creature, flattened out and rolled
down, will make an excellent bath mat. The rag girl
can be ripped up into wash cloths and the boy boiled
down to soap fat.”</p>

<p>“Bath mat!” roared the little bear, putting back
his ears. “Why, you can’t make a bath mat out of
me. Don’t you know I’m a pet? You’d better not
touch Scraps either, she’s a Queen and Peter’s a
pitcher!”</p>

<p>“Pause!” commanded the Sultan, extending his
arm wearily.</p>

<p>“I’ll pause and claw you!” threatened Grumpy,
doubling up his furry fists. “We’re on our way to
the Emerald City to save the Queen and you daren’t
stop us!” While Grumpy was saying, or rather growling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
all this, Peter had noticed an open window at
the back of the throne room. Signaling to Scraps,
he pushed aside the soap slaves and, seizing Grumpy’s
paw, made a grand slide for freedom. Scraps reached
the window first and recklessly jumped. Then Peter
and Grumpy, without one look, jumped down after
her. Fortunately, Scraps landed first so that the little
bear and the little boy had something soft to fall
upon. The drop from the window was nearly thirty
feet and they looked around rather breathlessly.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_181" style="max-width: 80.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_181.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“Did we hurt you?” asked Peter, hopping up
quickly and pulling Grumpy to his feet.</p>

<p>“No!” puffed the Patchwork Girl, raising her head
experimentally, “but I feel rather flat. Shake me
up, boys, and then we’d better run.” So Grumpy took
one of her arms and Peter the other and they shook
with all their might. Scraps’ cotton stuffing was
still damp from the rubber tree’s shower and her
face had a wrinkled and rough-dry look but, quite
cheerfully, she patted herself into shape. They had
fallen on a flat gray beach and, leaning down to
examine the soil, Peter discovered it was sand soap.
Without stopping to discover anything more, they
started to run along the shore of a deep blue lake.
As the waves broke on the shore, they frothed and
foamed beautifully and dancing soap bubbles formed
and floated over the waves. At any other time Peter
would have liked to stop and admire the view but,
fearing pursuit, they all ran along as fast as they
could. Cliffs of soap stone rose steeply in places and
there seemed no way to cross the lake nor to escape
from the slippery clutches of the Sultan of Suds.
Finally rounding a large cliff, they came to an abandoned
soap building. White soap bricks were lying
about in orderly piles and stacked against the building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
itself were several huge slabs of soap, evidently
intended for doors. Picking up one of the soap bricks,
Peter hurled it into the lake and, as it floated jauntily
off, threw his cap into the air.</p>

<p>“I have it!” cried Peter gaily. “This soap floats.
We’ll drag one of the big pieces down to the edge
of the lake and float across.”</p>

<p>It was hard work, for the slab they chose was both
thick and heavy, but at last, after much pulling, tugging,
grunting and pushing, they managed to launch
their queer raft. Peter and Grumpy carried Scraps
out so she would not get wet again, then, climbing
carefully aboard themselves, sat down on the slippery
surface. Peter had sensibly brought along a
long bar of green soap and, using this as a pole, he
pushed the raft out into the current.</p>

<p>“Good-bye to Suds!” yelled Scraps, as they slipped
smoothly over the blue waters of the lake,</p>

Friend Oztrich Offers To Help</h2>


<p>They were half way across the sudsy lake before
any of the Suds themselves appeared. Then a
whole company of them rushed down to the shore.
Peter waved his cap cheerfully and, redoubling his
efforts with the soap bar, pushed their raft toward
the opposite bank.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ve wasted a lot of time,” puffed
Peter, as the raft slid in toward the beach.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” grinned Scraps, “we’ve something
new to talk about. I’m glad we met the Suds, Peter.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” sniffed Grumpy, balancing himself carefully.
“I’m glad they met us. Now they’ll have
something new to talk about, something worth
while.” Peter chuckled a little at this and, seizing
Scraps’ hands, helped her to rise, for little waves
were rippling aboard and he did not want the Patchwork<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
Girl to fade or shrink. But without any accidents
or spills the raft washed up on the beach and
they all jumped off.</p>

<p>“Do you think you still know which direction to
take?” asked Peter anxiously.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Which direction to take, which direction to take,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">What kind of a desert is this we have struck?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Throwing up her arms, Scraps looked around in
dismay.</p>

<p>“A wilderness!” quavered the little bear, sitting
down resignedly on a tree stump. Shading his eyes,
Peter stared off in the distance. As far as he could
see, there was nothing but a barren stretch of desert,
with here and there a tree or jagged rock.</p>

<p>“Let’s start toward that tall pine,” suggested
Peter, pulling his cap down hard over his left eye and
waving toward a pine tree just visible on the sky line.
“If we keep walking we’re bound to come out somewhere,
but I’m afraid we’ll never catch up with Ruggedo
now.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s lost, too,” said Grumpy, ambling along
beside Scraps on all fours.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
<figure class="figcenter illowp55" id="i_187" style="max-width: 51.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_187.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Yes, but he has a magic cloak to help him,” sighed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
Peter, “and all we have is an emerald we don’t know
how to work.”</p>

<p>“Which tree are we walking toward?” asked
Scraps, blinking her suspender button eyes rapidly.
“I don’t see any pine tree now, Peter.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” growled Grumpy, rising up on his
hind legs, and neither did Peter when he looked
again. As he strained his eyes for a glimpse of the
missing tree, all the stumps and stones around them
began to change places as naturally as if it were quite
the usual thing to do, while the sand beneath their
feet began to slip and slide uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t this make your hair curl?” Breathing
hard, Grumpy edged close to Scraps. As he did, a
whole cluster of bushes jumped up and, seizing
branches, danced madly about the three travellers.</p>

<p>“Here we go ’round the mulberry bush—mulberry
bush—mulberry bush!” chanted Scraps, putting her
hands up to her eyes.</p>

<p>“You mean, here they go ’round us!” mumbled
Peter dizzily. “Stop! Stop! Go away, I never saw
anything so silly.”</p>

<p>The bushes, however, went gaily on with their
dance, but when they had circled around the travellers
at least a hundred times, they seemed to tire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
of the sport and all of them skipped off together.</p>

<p>“This makes me cross,” growled Grumpy, scowling
terribly.</p>

<p>“Well, it makes me cross-eyed,” acknowledged
Scraps, starting forward uncertainly. “Look out for
that tree, Peter, it’s going to trip you if it can. I’ll
tell you, let’s shut our eyes and run!” Trying to walk
straight ahead with trees, rocks and bushes jumping
about like colts was certainly a problem and, closing
their eyes, they did begin to run. But a young
tree, dropping across their path, soon put a stop to
that and they all fell sprawling together. Rubbing
his knees, Peter sat up.</p>

<p>“Wish we had Kuma’s hand to guide us through
this place,” muttered the little boy, brushing his hand
wearily across his forehead.</p>

<p>“What we need is blinkers,” sniffed Grumpy.
“Hello, I see something that hasn’t moved for a whole
minute.”</p>

<p>“Where?” Peter and Scraps spoke in the same
breath. Swallowing hard, Grumpy waved his paw
toward a great feathery bush, with three main
branches. Without a word they kept their eyes fixed
upon it for several minutes. Then Peter, jumping up
determinedly and giving no heed to the skipping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
stones and slipping sands, ran straight for the bush.
As fast as they could, Grumpy and the Patchwork
Girl followed him. It was quite a distance and Scraps
was tripped up several times on the way, but at last
they stood before the only stationary object in that
whole whirling wilderness.</p>

<p>“Feathers!” gasped Peter, pushing back his cap.</p>

<p>“And it’s alive,” cautioned Grumpy, moving back
a few steps. “See, it has feet.”</p>

<p>“It looks like—it may be—why, it <i>is</i>!” Rushing
forward, Scraps tapped the strange creature smartly
on the leg. Peter had supposed it had three legs and
no head, but at the Patchwork Girl’s tap, a head
burst through the sandy soil and, rearing its long
neck, an Oztrich looked at them inquiringly. Now
an Oztrich, I don’t mind telling you, is quite like an
ostrich, except that it has green feathers and blue
eyes.</p>

<p>“Well?” hissed the oztrich, looking sadly from one
to the other. “Where do you think you’re going?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we want to know,” cried Scraps, for
Peter was too surprised to speak. “Where are we
going, how do we get there and what is your name?”</p>

<p>“My name is Ozwold,” answered the great bird
gently. “How do you feel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“Dizzy!” groaned Grumpy weakly.</p>

<p>“Bewildered,” sighed Scraps, jumping aside to let
three rocks roll by.</p>

<p>“I thought so.” The Oztrich shook its head in a
satisfied manner. “This is a Bewilderness, you know.
Bury your heads like I do,” he advised calmly.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_191" style="max-width: 82.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_191.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“But we want to go to the Emerald City,” put in
Peter, “and if we bury our heads we’d smother.
Couldn’t you carry us to the Emerald City on your
back?” he asked daringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Ozzy, if you only would!” Clasping her hands,
Scraps rolled her suspender button eyes pleadingly at
the huge bird.</p>

<p>“Who’d take care of my child?” objected the Oztrich,
blinking its eyes very fast and indicating with
its bill an enormous egg lying beside it in the sand.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you a wife?” asked Peter in surprise.</p>

<p>“She’s gone home to visit her mother,” explained
the Oztrich in an embarrassed tone. “I must stay
here till the egg hatches.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we take it with us?” proposed Peter
eagerly. “Think how proud you’d be to have your
child hatch out in the capital!”</p>

<p>“Ozma would give it a hatchday present, too,”
added Scraps coaxingly.</p>

<p>“If you stay here, a rock will probably rush by and
break it to pieces. It’s a wonder to me it hasn’t been
broken long ago,” sniffed Grumpy, leaning over to
touch the egg with his paw.</p>

<p>“Great moguls! I never thought of that!” Shifting
from one foot to the other, the oztrich looked nervously
down at his child. “If you carry my egg I <i>will</i>
go away from here,” he murmured in a troubled
voice. “Might as well go to the Emerald City. I’ve
always wanted to see the Capital. Just wait though,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
till I get my bearings!” Burying his head in the sand
again, the oztrich stood perfectly motionless for
nearly ten minutes. Fidgeting with impatience and
dodging trees and rocks as best they could, Peter and
his companions waited anxiously for the head to re-appear.
It came up so suddenly, when it did come,
that Grumpy fell over backward.</p>

<p>“Don’t speak,” warned Ozwold in a tense voice.
“Don’t speak or I’m lost. Climb up and we’ll start at
once!”</p>

<p>Scraps, taking a running jump, landed safely on
the oztrich’s back. Then Peter carefully handed up
the egg and, boosted by the little bear, took his place
behind Scraps. Grumpy himself climbed aloft with
no difficulty and before they were fairly settled the
oztrich began pounding across the Bewilderness. It
missed all the trees and rocks very cleverly and, as it
travelled nearly a mile a minute, conversation was
out of the question. Scraps, for greater security,
wound her long arms about its neck, Peter had his
arms round Scrap’s waist, the egg balanced carefully
in his lap and Grumpy, blinking and gasping,
bounced up and down behind Peter.</p>

<p>“I hope it knows where it’s going,” thought Peter,
as the wind whistled through his hair and the desert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
sand stung his cheeks and eyelids. For almost a half
hour the oztrich rushed along like an express, then
changing its gait began to travel more slowly. They
had come to the end of the Bewilderness by now and
Peter was relieved to see again the yellow farms and
fields of the Winkies.</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of something!” exclaimed Peter,
leaning forward to whisper in the Patchwork Girl’s
ear. “If Ruggedo is afraid of hen’s eggs wouldn’t
an oztrich egg frighten him much more?”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! hurray, well I should say!” Squirming
round, Scraps looked delightedly at the huge egg in
Peter’s lap. “As soon as you see Ruggedo, throw it
at his head,” advised Scraps, in an excited whisper.</p>

<p>“But I promised to keep it safe for the oztrich,”
objected Peter uneasily, “and I can’t break my promise,
can I?”</p>

<p>“You’d be breaking the egg, not your promise,”
said Scraps earnestly. “Besides, Ozma’s more important
than an oztrich egg.”</p>

<p>“I’ll threaten to throw it,” decided Peter. “Anyway,
we’ll wait till we come to the Emerald City.
Hello, what’s this?” Looming up ahead was a high
yellow wall. With a snort of displeasure, the oztrich
came to a halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Do you see any gate?” he wheezed, curling his
long neck around at Peter.</p>

<p>“I see something over there to the right,” answered
the little boy, “but are you sure this is a safe place
to go through?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_195" style="max-width: 112.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_195.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“No,” admitted the Oztrich hoarsely, “but unless
we go through, how are we to go on to the Emerald
City?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp55" id="i_196" style="max-width: 50em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_196.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“I’ll open the gate,” volunteered Scraps, slipping
easily to the ground. Running over to the right,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
Scraps soon found the hollowed out space Peter had
noticed, but instead of a gate, an upright piano was
wedged into the opening. Scraps tried to see over
the top, but it was too tall. Then she tried to shove
it aside, but it was too heavy. So shrugging her
shoulders and tossing back her yarn, Scraps sat
down at the piano and started to play the Grand
March of Oz, which she had been practicing faithfully
on Dorothy’s piano back at the palace. At the first
chord, the piano, as if moved on an invisible hinge,
fell backwards and Scraps, taken entirely by surprise,
jumped over the top. The oztrich was not slow to
follow and he had barely jumped over the fallen
piano before it snapped back into its upright position,
shutting them into the queerest city Peter had yet
seen.</p>

Tune Town Sings The Wanderers Onward</h2>


<p>“Now how did this happen!” Sitting exactly where
she had fallen, Scraps folded her arms dramatically.</p>

<p>“Opening chords!” boomed a deep voice, and out
from a niche in the wall sprang a handsome person
in a bandmaster’s uniform. “The gates of Tune
Town are locked with piano keys,” he explained graciously,
“so when you struck the opening chords, of
course you fell in.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” murmured Ozwold. “But now that
we are in, how do we get out?”</p>

<p>“Out of tune?” exclaimed the bandmaster in a
shocked voice. “Don’t get out of tune, I beg of you,
besides it’s against the law. May I call your attention
to our principle laws here?”</p>

<p>Raising his baton he pointed to a large poster on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
the wall and much to his astonishment, Peter read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No talking allowed, sing!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No walking permitted, dance!”</div>

</div>

<p>“But you’re talking,” said Peter, shifting the
oztrich egg from one knee to the other.</p>

<p>“Ah, but this is the intermission. In a moment the
music will begin and you must keep time, keep step
and keep moving. We do everything to music here.
Quick now, which would you rather do, sing and
dance or play in the band? That bear ought to be in
the band, he has such bandy legs? Would you care
to be in the band, creature?”</p>

<p>Grumpy slid down from the oztrich and shook his
head bashfully. “Let’s stick together,” he rumbled
under his breath to Peter. “Tell him we’re a quartet.”</p>

<p>“This is very awk,” sighed Ozwold, who always
clipped off his words when he was annoyed. “I am
a bird but I cannot sing a single note.”</p>

<p>“Then keep quiet and dance,” advised the bandmaster.</p>

<p>“But look here!” put in Peter impatiently. “We
don’t want to sing and dance, we just want to go
through your town. We’re in an awful hurry and
haven’t time to be in a show.”</p>

<p>“Say ‘Ah!’” commanded the bandmaster, giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
no attention to Peter’s remarks. Striking a tuning
fork on a railing before him, he waited expectantly
for them to begin. Raising one eyebrow Peter looked
at Scraps and as Scraps, jumping to her feet, winked
her suspender button eyes, they both burst into a loud
“ah,” Grumpy and Ozwold joining in so vigorously
that the bandmaster’s cap blew off.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp98" id="i_201" style="max-width: 76.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_201.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“That’s fine,” he approved, picking his cap up
somewhat nervously. “And now you’re in tune.
When the music starts go where you wish, do what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
you want, but be sure to keep step and remember
to sing, not to speak, or you will be arrested.”</p>

<p>“Oompah! Oompah! Who are these strangers?”
Dancing down the marble street came a small
bobbed-haired Queen, with a very short skirt and a
tunic embroidered all over with fiddles and horns. On
her head for a crown was a hollowed out drum and by
her side was a tom-tom cat, clattering and clanging
as he ran along.</p>

<p>“Travellers, my dear Jazzma,” answered the bandmaster
with a bow. As the Queen stared curiously
at the travellers and they as curiously stared back,
the loud roll of a drum sounded in the distance. Instantly
from every dwelling marched men arrayed in
gay uniforms like Oompahs and Tunesters in embroidered
tunics like the Queen’s, only instead of
drums, on their heads they wore bright bandannas.</p>

<p>“It’s a play!” murmured Peter, as Oompah placed
himself hastily at the head of the band and all the
Tunesters stood waiting with toes stiffly pointed.
When Oompah raised his baton, the band burst into a
lively march and the whole population began dancing
in every direction. Some of the women and girls
danced toward the markets, singing out their orders
in rhyme, others began sweeping the pavements, carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
on long conversations in song as they swept.
Everybody was doing something and doing it to
music. It really was quite gay and, fluttering his
plumes importantly, the oztrich began strutting along
in perfect time to the music. Grumpy watching the
Queen, who was just ahead, slid and shuffled along
skilfully. As for Scraps, she simply outdid herself.
Peter, from his vantage point on the oztrich’s back,
watched the whole performance with great interest,
feeling exactly as if he were in a circus parade. The
inhabitants of Tune Town seemed all to live in flats
and the walls of their dwellings were covered with
lines, notes and scales, while all the streets were
marked with musical signs. The trees, instead of
leaves, bore musical notes and when the wind swept
through them played silvery tunes that mixed not
unpleasantly with the music of the band. Song birds
fluttered in the branches and, quite forgetting the
law against speaking, Peter called out to Grumpy
to look at them.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>warbled the Queen, waving a drum stick at Peter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
Peter grew very red and while he was trying to think
up a rhymed reply the music started again and
Scraps, capering up to Jazzma, chanted gaily:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“You really are a funny nation,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And must we sing our conversation?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Queen, taking three steps to the right and
four to the left, nodded vigorously and, looking
admiringly at the Patchwork Girl, sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Maiden stay, you are so gay,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">My maid in waiting you shall be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And live in rag time harmonee!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Peter waited anxiously for Scraps to answer. Tune
Town was so jolly, he was almost afraid Scraps would
forget their important mission. But Scraps, for all
her giddiness, was deeply attached to Ozma and extremely
worried about the plans of Ruggedo for her
downfall. So kicking up her heels, she sang out
saucily:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And that your Majesty would mean</div>

  </div>
</div>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_205.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Turning a cartwheel, Scraps walked a few paces
on her hands, then coming right side up, danced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
amiably along beside Jazzma. Peter chuckled to
himself and hoped he would remember all of this
nonsense to tell his grandfather. Then, suddenly
catching sight of a small Inn, set back among the
tune trees, he reached over and touched Scraps on
the shoulder. He was terribly hungry, but not being
quick at rhymes could not put his hunger into song.
Scraps, however, caught his meaning at once and
again turned to address the Queen. She had to sing
quite loud for all the Tunesters were warbling about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
this and that till the confusion was terrible.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Your Majesty, my friends crave food!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>bawled Scraps not untunefully.</p>

<p>The Queen, who was dancing a fox trot and purchasing
a bouquet from a flower girl at the same time,
nodded graciously and screamed back:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Eat if you wish, our Viol Inn</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But eat in time and use your feet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Be careful not to drop a beat!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Scraps sang back to Queen Jazzma:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Using one’s feet to eat’s a feat</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“If anyone drops a beat, I’ll eat it,” mumbled
Grumpy under his breath. Fortunately no one heard
him, and in a few moments they reached the Inn.
Pausing at the foot of the steps and still marking
time to the music, they stared up with great interest.
As they did so an old gentleman with a fiddle body
and bow legs came skipping out on the porch.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Before you eat, you must pay me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In harmonee, sweet harmonee!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>sang the Inn Keeper, accompanying himself upon his
fiddle body with one bow leg, while he stood upon the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“Does he mean we have to sing?” whispered Peter,
sliding off the oztrich and setting the egg down carefully
under a tree. Scraps nodded and while Grumpy
and the oztrich rolled their eyes at her pleadingly, she
clasped her cotton hands and sang with great feeling
a song she had made up about Sir Hokus, the
Good Knight of Oz.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“As brave as a lion, as bold as a King,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is Sir Hokus of Pokes; he can fight, he can sing,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And whenever one happens, he’s sure to be in it!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Well, he’s not in this one,” thought Peter almost
as interested in Scraps’ song as the Inn Keeper. As
Daddy Linn was now bowing and smiling and motioning
for them to come up, they started quite cheerfully
up the steps. But no sooner had they set foot
upon the first one than the whole flight danced off.
You see, they were dance steps, all the steps in Tune
Town are, but after dancing three polkas and a three-step,
they waltzed back to the porch and somewhat
dizzily the travellers jumped off.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let’s run away, let’s run away,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I can’t keep dancing here all day,”</div>

</div>

<p>puffed Ozwold, proud to have made up a song at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p>“Eeney meeney miney mo, first you eat and then
you go,” answered Scraps. Peter and Grumpy quite
agreed with her and, shuffling their feet in time to
the music, they waited impatiently for the Inn Keeper
to re-appear. When he did come out he had four
leather music rolls on a tray and handed them around
as if they were the most delicious morsels imaginable.</p>

<p>“Fie! Fie! Have you no pie!” sang Scraps, while
Peter and Grumpy shook their heads in disappointment.</p>

<p>Ozwold pecked savagely at one of the rolls, but
even he could not eat leather.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pie? I have a grand piana,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How would that suit, Miss Diana?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Inn Keeper looked inquiringly at the Patchwork
Girl and, when she shook her head, danced
crossly into the Inn and slammed the door.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No wonder they call this a Viol Inn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No dinner at all, just a dreadful din!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>mumbled Scraps, who hated to have Peter disappointed.
Peter, with a sigh, jumped over the flighty
dance steps, picked up the oztrich egg and, with
Grumpy shuffling disconsolately after, started back
toward the main street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“Very awk—when one can’t talk,” wheezed the oztrich,
rolling its eyes sadly at Peter.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Never mind, a way I’ll find,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tunester, will you be so kind—”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Touching a Tunester on the sleeve, Scraps trilled
earnestly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mister, will you show us how</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To leave this town? We’re going now.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To get out of Tune, get out of Tune!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You’ll find yourselves out, pretty soon,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>chuckled the singer, waltzing away unconcernedly.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose he means by that?” exclaimed
Peter, forgetting that he was breaking the
law again. No sooner had he spoken than the music
and dancing stopped and this time the whole band
rushed toward him with instruments threateningly
upraised.</p>

<p>“Scream!” puffed the Patchwork Girl, struck by a
sudden idea. “Altogether now, Ah!” Not knowing
what else to do, Peter, Grumpy and the Oztrich
screamed “Ah” as loudly as they could, Scraps joining
in with a will. As each one screamed in a different
key, the result was a perfectly dreadful discord.
Covering their ears and dropping their horns and
drums, the members of the band, Jazzma and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
Tunesters fled in every direction. Before the last
echoes of that “Ah!” had died away, the four offenders
found themselves out of Tune indeed, though how
they had gotten over the wall not one of them could
have told you.</p>

<p>“Did we blow over?” asked Peter, looking down
anxiously at the oztrich egg to see if it was broken.</p>

<p>“No,” giggled Scraps, throwing a kiss in the direction
of the wall, “we sang out of tune, Peter, and
here we are out of Tune. Which road shall we take,
boys?” There were three roads leading away from
Tune Town and after quite a debate they chose the
center one.</p>

<p>“I hope we find something to eat soon,” sighed
Peter, as Ozwold started briskly down the road. “I’m
hungry as a bear!”</p>

<p>“Not as this bear,” growled Grumpy, patting his
middle sorrowfully.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_14">CHAPTER 14<br>
Ozwold And His Friends Rush On</h2>


<p>“That was a fine place for you, Scraps,” chuckled
Peter as the oztrich thudded good humoredly
along the sunny road. “You’d rather sing than talk
anyway. But singing and dancing all your life,
whew! How would you play base ball to music, I
wonder. Imagine singing out signals and trying to
make a home run to a waltz.”</p>

<p>“The dinners were the saddest,” sighed Grumpy,
licking his chops hungrily. “Do you see any biscuit
bushes or carrot trees around here?”</p>

<p>“There’s some kind of a tree in that field,” answered
Peter, “but the fruit is up so high we couldn’t
reach it, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I could,” grunted the little bear eagerly. “Let’s
stop and try.” The oztrich had spied some especially
appetizing rocks by the roadside and was quite willing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
to stop. So Peter placed his egg child beside him
and, while they ran off to investigate the fruit tree,
Ozwold lunched quite contentedly on a couple of cobblestones.
The tree was about as tall as a cocoanut
palm and clustered at the top were large green
fruits about the size of watermelons.</p>

<p>Requiring no luncheon, Scraps danced off to amuse
herself and, as Peter and Grumpy blinked hungrily
upward, two of the melons detached themselves from
the branch of the tree and came sailing gracefully
downward.</p>

<p>“Why, they’ve umbrellas over them,” gasped
Peter.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said the little bear calmly. “Have you
never seen an umbrella melon?” Peter never had
and said so quite frankly.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_215" style="max-width: 93.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_215.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Well,” explained Grumpy, placing himself in a
position to catch the larger of the two. “If they
didn’t have these umbrella attachments they’d smash
to pieces when they fell. As it is, when the fruit is
ripe the umbrella leaves open and float them safely
down. Ah-hh!” Holding out both arms, Grumpy
neatly caught his melon and, hugging it blissfully, sat
down to enjoy his first meal since leaving Patch.
Peter had to chase his luncheon all around the field,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
for the breeze was brisk and the umbrella attachment
larger than the melon itself. But finally he did manage
to overtake it and bringing the melon back,
settled down beside Grumpy. Cutting off the umbrella
leaves with his pen knife, Peter split the melon
in two. It was something like a cantaloupe, only
much larger and much sweeter and to the tired, hungry,
dusty little traveller, it tasted perfectly delicious.
But, hungry as he was, half the melon was all he could
eat and he looked in admiring astonishment as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
Grumpy burrowed his nose deeper and deeper into
his. The entire center was gone and he was nibbling
at the rind when Scraps came hurrying back across
the field.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Are you boys going to eat all day?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Glad I don’t waste <i>my</i> time that way!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“You don’t know what you miss, Miss.” Licking
his nose, Grumpy grinned up at the Patchwork Girl,
but Scraps, sticking out her tongue, merely turned a
cartwheel, jumped over a fence, and landed neatly on
the back of Ozwold. Peter and Grumpy were not
slow to follow, for they were all anxious to reach
the capital before nightfall.</p>

<p>“Is my child safe?” mumbled Ozwold as well as he
could with the two cobblestones still sticking in his
throat. “Whatever you do, don’t drop my child. He
is my wife’s favorite egg. I do hope he doesn’t hatch
out before we reach the Emerald City!”</p>

<p>“So do I,” breathed Peter, looking quite nervously
at the huge egg in his lap. “Have you ever been in
the Emerald City?” he asked politely.</p>

<p>“No,” answered the oztrich slowly. “Have you?”
Peter shook his head and as Ozwold jogged along the
lane, Scraps told him all about the capital of Oz and
the delightful people who live there, ending up with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
the story of Ruggedo’s escape and his wicked plan to
steal all the Oz magic and make himself ruler of the
realm.</p>

<p>“Ruler of Oz!” screamed the oztrich, stopping in
consternation. “Great grandmothers, why didn’t you
tell me this before? Why, if that old gnome has a
flying cloak, he’s probably reached the Emerald City
and captured everybody by this time. A gnome on
the throne of Oz, how perfectly impos! Ruggedo
ruler of Oz, how simply ridick!” At each word Ozwold
grew more indignant, and finally, with a screech
like an engine whistle, he hurled himself forward,
running along at such speed that trees, fences, farms
and hills whirled by in a blur of dust and Peter and
the others had all they could do to keep their places.
Hugging the oztrich egg with one arm and Scraps
with the other, Peter blinked and bounced and tried
to catch a glimpse of the country they were passing
or the country they were coming to. But between
the speed and the dust, he could see nothing.</p>

<p>“If he’s just going in the right direction,” thought
the little boy, closing his eyes and gritting his teeth
to keep them from chattering, “we’ll get there in no
time. If he isn’t—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>“Whoa! Whoa!” roared Grumpy, as long as he
had breath enough to roar. Even Scraps tried to
check the mad plunge of their excited steed. But
finally they all stopped shouting and devoted all their
energies to hanging on. Peter rather expected they
would run into something and so was not greatly
surprised to find himself sitting in the middle of the
road. Scraps sprawled beside him and Grumpy, rubbing
his head, limped crossly out of a ditch. Ozwold
himself was leaning up against a tree with both eyes
closed, while across the roadway lay an extremely
upset and odd looking traveller.</p>

<p>“I told you to whoa,” growled Grumpy, shaking
his paw angrily. “Now see what you’ve done!”</p>

<p>“Never say whoa to an oztrich,” muttered the
green bird, opening one eye. “Say whum!”</p>

<p>“But we’ve run over somebody,” exclaimed Peter.</p>

<p>“Is my child broken?” asked the oztrich, opening
the other eye and peering wildly in every direction.
Fortunately the egg had fallen on a heap of soft
sand and while Ozwold hurried over to assure himself
it was not cracked, Scraps and Peter ran to help the
stranger.</p>

<p>quavered the Patchwork Girl, leaning over him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>“It’s all right,” sighed the stranger, sitting up
slowly. “I’m used to being slammed. Just so my
back’s not broken, I don’t care!”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a book!” burst out Peter, coming closer
to make sure.</p>

<p>“Not a book, a bookman!” corrected the traveller,
rising with Scrap’s help to his feet. “Books are old
fashioned, but a bookman is right up to date. I don’t
wait to be advertised, I speak for myself, I don’t lie
around waiting to be read, I run after people and
make them read me. I can carry myself and turn
over a new leaf every day in the year. I’m very
interesting!” finished the bookman, with a wide smile
at Peter. Peter smiled back and how could he help
it? Above his big book body the fellow had a round
jolly face with floppy dog ears. His legs and arms
were quite thin and he was about as tall as Scraps.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you’re not hurt?” asked the little
boy, as the bookman began to run briskly up and
down thumping the covers of his book body to knock
out the dust.</p>

<p>“What are you about?” asked Grumpy, looking
curiously at the traveller and still rubbing his head
with his paw. “Have you any animal tales?”</p>

<p>“Or verse?” cried the Patchwork Girl eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>“Or baseball stories?” questioned Peter, coming
closer and closer. In their interest they had almost
forgotten the oztrich.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_221" style="max-width: 86.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_221.png" alt="">

<p>“I’ve all kinds of stories,” boasted the bookman
and, unclasping his middle, spread wide the pages of
his book. “Which will you have first?”</p>

<p>“A bear story,” said Grumpy, sitting down on his
haunches and waving both paws. “Bear stories are
the most exciting!”</p>

<p>“No, a verse,” shrilled the Patchwork Girl quickly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
Peter was about to call for a baseball story when he
suddenly remembered his manners.</p>

<p>“Ladies first,” said Peter, looking reprovingly at
the little bear. “Just show us one of your verses,”
he remarked carelessly.</p>

<p>“Funny or sad?” asked the bookman, running his
finger down his table of contents.</p>

<p>“Funny, of course,” chuckled Scraps, tossing her
head impatiently. Turning his pages rapidly the
bookman stepped off a few paces and, leaning forward,
the three travellers read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Do fishes use the liquid tones</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The world so highly praises?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Could they speak dryly, and do bees</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Converse in honeyed phrases?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” laughed Peter merrily, “if they do
they’d soon get stuck. That’s a good one—almost as
good as your verses, Scraps.”</p>

<p>“There’s a much funnier one on page seventy-six,”
said the bookman gaily. “Wait!”</p>

<p>“What for?” Coming up behind them, Ozwold
looked severely at their new friend. “What are we
waiting for?” he repeated sternly.</p>

<p>“This is the man you ran over,” explained Peter
quickly, “and he’s letting us read his book.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>“And you stand here reading with the whole Kingdom
in danger?” hissed the oztrich, thrusting his
long neck forward angrily. “A nice way to save the
Queen, I must say.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a chapter on saving, somewhere, but I’m
afraid it’s on saving money,” mumbled the bookman,
thumbing his pages over hurriedly. Peter and Scraps
looked rather crest-fallen and, while they walked
slowly toward the oztrich, he again addressed the
bookman.</p>

<p>“If you know so much, perhaps you can tell us the
way to the Emerald City,” he wheezed disagreeably.</p>

<p>“I’m not a guide book,” answered the bookman
stiffly.</p>

<p>“Then shut up,” advised the oztrich so sharply that
without intending to at all the bookman did shut up.</p>

<p>“Are you coming, or do I have to save the Kingdom
myself?” asked the oztrich, turning impatiently to
Peter.</p>

<p>“I’ll come, too, and entertain you as you go along.
Read as you run,” said the bookman brightly.</p>

<p>“Not as I run,” sniffed Ozwold, who seemed determined
to snub this new acquaintance. “Better
keep out of my way or you’ll be run over again.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you will,” sighed Peter, patting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
bookman kindly on the back, for he seemed quite
crushed by Ozwold’s rude speeches.</p>

<p>Scraps had already mounted the oztrich and now,
leaning far out to the side, shook hands with the
bookman, singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Bookman! Bookman, don’t you care,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We’ll see you some day somewhere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come to the Emerald City, do</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then I’ll read you through and through!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“So will I,” promised Grumpy earnestly. “You’ll
find us in the palace. Just ask for the Queen of the
Quilties and her pet,” finished the little bear grandly.</p>

<p>“There won’t be any palace if you stand here much
longer,” fumed the oztrich, kicking up the dust
angrily. “<i>Come on!</i>”</p>

<p>Realizing that there was some truth in the oztrich’s
remarks, Peter picked up the huge egg and climbed
aboard. Grumpy, growling under his breath, took
his seat behind Peter.</p>

<p>“This is no time for improving literature,” hissed
the oztrich, starting off at a two legged trot. Peter
did not bother to answer, but waved his cap cheerily
to the bookman, who still stood uncertainly in the
middle of the road. He kept on waving till the bookman
became a mere speck in the distance, then, turning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
about, devoted all his attention to holding on.
For nearly an hour Ozwold pelted down the endless
road. Then suddenly Scraps clutched him excitedly
about the neck.</p>

<p>“Stop!” shouted the Patchwork Girl. “Stop! Stop!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” coughed the oztrich, slackening
his speed a trifle.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Turn out between those pear trees quick,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I see the road of yellow brick,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>cried Scraps, waving one arm joyfully over her head.</p>

<p>“Where does that take us?” inquired Peter, leaning
curiously over Scraps’ shoulder.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To the Emerald City’s golden gate;</div>

</div>

<p>sang Scraps, nearly choking the oztrich in her excitement.
“Hurry, Ozzy, hurry! Hurry!”</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to whum when you come to the Emerald
City,” grumbled Grumpy, as the great green bird
gathered itself together for another burst of speed.</p>

<p>“The Emerald City may be destroyed for all we
know,” wheezed Ozwold gloomily. “But hold tight,
everybody. Here we go!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_15">CHAPTER 15<br>
Wumbo, Wonder Worker, At Home</h2>


<p>The Gillikin Country of Oz has always been a
favorite retreat for witches, wizards and sorcerers.
Since the practice of magic has been forbidden
for everyone except Glinda, the Good Sorceress of
the South, and the Wizard of Oz, a great many of
the lesser wizards and magic workers have retired
to the mountains of the north to practice in secret
or study for their own satisfaction the ancient art
of wizardry.</p>

<p>In a crystal cavern on the western slope of Zamagoochie
lived Wumbo, the Wonder Worker. In his
youth, Wumbo had studied in the best schools of
sorcery and was not only an accomplished magician,
but a lovable and loyal citizen of Oz. Therefore,
when Ozma passed a law against the practice of
magic, Wumbo withdrew to his favorite cave and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
quietly and harmlessly continued his studies. Now,
of all studies sorcery is the most profitable. Being
able to grant most of his own wishes, Wumbo lived
in the utmost comfort and contentment, his cavern
being almost as magnificent and luxurious as Ozma’s
castle. From preference, Wumbo lived by himself,
but was seldom lonely, for when you can conjure up
a company of acrobats from a handful of pebbles,
or an orchestra from a few sticks and dried peas,
you are always sure of entertainment. Long after
ordinary Oz folk were in their beds, Wumbo, in his
crystal study, would pore over his musty books of
magic, trying out new spells and charms for his own
satisfaction and amusement.</p>

<p>He was especially fond of his book of Chants and
Enchantments and, on the evening I am writing of,
sat beside his great crystal lamp, turning over its
leaves and humming cheerfully to himself.</p>

<p>“I think,” mused Wumbo at last, “I shall use the
speech-giving chant, to-night. It’s been a long time
since I’ve talked with my furniture and no doubt it
has a lot to tell me!” Rubbing his hands gleefully,
Wumbo turned to page ninety-seven and, after reading
the chant several times to himself, walked over
to his foot-stool and, touching it gently, droned:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ooney, mooney, nooney nill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell me foot-stool what you will.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I need re-covering,” creaked the foot-stool
promptly. “And next time you trip over me, I trust
you will crack both shins.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_229" style="max-width: 71.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_229.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Ho! Ho!” roared the wizard, bending backward
and forward with mirth, “that’s nice of you. Anything
else?” As the foot-stool made no further remark,
he walked to the mantel and touched the clock.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ooney, mooney, nooney nill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell me, old clock, what you will.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“Your wig’s on crooked,” ticked the clock critically,
“and there’s a smudge on the end of your
nose.” Looking in the glass, Wumbo saw that the
clock, as usual, was telling the truth. Straightening
his wig, he went next to his favorite chair.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ooney, mooney, nooney nill,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell me, arm-chair, what you will!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>chanted Wumbo, putting both hands in his pockets.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s sitting on me,” complained the chair
in a stuffy voice.</p>

<p>“Somebody’s sitting on you,” gasped Wumbo in
astonishment. “Why, I don’t see anybody!”</p>

<p>“Then feel ’em,” whispered the chair hoarsely.
Putting out his hand cautiously, Wumbo touched a
long wispy beard and immediately jumped back with
a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>“Fold your arms! Fold your arms!” spluttered
the Wonder Worker, rushing back to the Book of
Enchantments. The chair lost no time in obeying
this order. Instead of ordinary arms, Wumbo’s chair
had real ones and it clasped them about the invisible
sitter, so that he could neither move, scream nor
scarcely breathe. Meanwhile, with trembling fingers,
Wumbo fluttered over the pages of the Chant
Book, till he found the exact one he was searching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
for—the chant to render visible the invisible.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ominey, hominey, dominey deer,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I command you invisible one to appear!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>mumbled Wumbo, straightening his specs excitedly,
for he had had no visitors for seven years. Instantly
the figure of a gray gnome appeared in the arm-chair,
kicking, struggling and sputtering with fright
and fury. As Wumbo continued to stare at him, the
chair lowered one of its arms, and Ruggedo, for, of
course, it was the old Gnome King, jerked up his
head and roared loudly:</p>

<p>“Take me to the Emerald City! Take me to the
Emerald City!”</p>

<p>“Are you addressing me?” asked Wumbo, dropping
into a chair opposite the gnome and regarding
him attentively. “If you are, you may as well save
your breath. I have never practiced long-distance
magic and could not send you to the Emerald City,
even if I wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Who wants your old magic,” sneered Ruggedo.
“I’ve magic of my own. Take me to the Emerald
City. Take me to the Emerald City!” he screeched,
trying in vain to squirm out of the clutching arms
of Wumbo’s chair.</p>

<p>“You are evidently unfamiliar with one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
first and simplest of magic laws,” observed the
wizard reprovingly. “I see now that you are wearing
an invisible cloak, but two magic charms cannot work
at the same time and as I spoke first you will have
to wait till my chant wears off.”</p>

<p>“Who are you? Where am I? How dare you keep
me here!” panted Ruggedo furiously.</p>

<p>“You are in the Zamagoochie Country, in the humble
cave of Wumbo the Wonder Worker,” answered
the old gentleman quite amiably. “And as you came
here yourself, why blame me for trying to entertain
you as I see best?”</p>

<p>“I knew it! I knew it!” raged the Gnome King.
“This is Peter’s doing. When I catch that boy I’ll
turn him to a peach basket and jump on him! And
you, I suppose, are the father of that meddling Kuma
Party?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Wumbo in surprise. “Have you
met my son?” Ruggedo gave a spiteful nod, and began
to struggle anew with the arms of the chair.</p>

<p>“I command you to let me go,” puffed the Gnome
King. “I’ve important business in the Emerald City
and must reach there to-night.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that will be impossible,” sighed Wumbo
softly. “When my chair takes a fancy to a person,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
it sometimes hangs on to him for days and days.
Why not sit still and rest yourself,” he suggested,
folding his arms comfortably. Seeing that for the
present he was perfectly powerless, Ruggedo lay
back and glared at the old wizard, his red eyes snapping
with rage and resentment.</p>

<p>“I’ll report you to Ozma,” threatened the Gnome
King darkly. “You know perfectly well that you are
breaking the law, having all this magic furniture
and stuff.”</p>

<p>“Take your feet off my rounds,” ordered the chair
sharply, giving Ruggedo a good squeeze.</p>

<p>“How about your magic cloak?” said Wumbo, smiling
a little as Ruggedo hastened to take his heels off
the rungs of the chair, “and how about turning a
boy to a peach basket? That sounds like pretty bad
magic to me. Who is this boy? And why are you
wearing a cloak of invisibility?”</p>

<p>“That’s my business,” muttered the gnome, looking
uneasily around. “Are you going to let me go
or not?”</p>

<p>“That depends on where you are going and what
you are going to do,” answered Wumbo, clapping his
hands three times. A box of chocolates instantly
appeared and tilted invitingly toward the wizard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
Helping himself, Wumbo offered a chocolate to Ruggedo,
but the gnome shook his head impatiently, so
Wumbo clapped his hands again and the chocolates
disappeared.</p>

<p>“I am going to the Emerald City to report the discovery
of a treasure ship,” explained the Gnome King
after a short silence. “I am going to have Ozma
transport the jewels and gold pieces to her own
castle. I’m making her a present of them,” finished
Ruggedo virtuously.</p>

<p>Wumbo said nothing but, rising slowly, went over
and stared into a great crystal ball on his desk. “That,
of course, is not true,” said Wumbo, coming back to
sit in his chair. “My crystal ball tells me that much
and my own eyes tell me that you are wicked and untrustworthy.
Therefore I shall keep you here until
I find some way to warn Ozma of your coming.”</p>

<p>At these words Ruggedo was simply beside himself.
Kicking and screaming and threatening Wumbo
with every sort of death and destruction, he writhed
about in the chair. But Wumbo was not easily frightened
and, picking up the Book of Enchantments, began
to read it to himself, while the arm chair, indignant
at the Gnome King’s bounces and screeches,
hugged him till he was forced to keep quiet. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
sitting there in the firelight, he did a lot of thinking,
and as it grew later and later and quieter and
quieter in the great crystal cavern, the Gnome King’s
spirits began to rise. For Ruggedo was beginning to
remember some of his magic.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_235" style="max-width: 60.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_235.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“If he doesn’t try any more chants, the present
ones will wear off in four hours,” thought the old
gnome craftily. “Four hours, and then for the magic
cloak!” Wumbo, himself, fully intended to keep a
strict watch over his visitor, but the heat from the
fire and the drowsy chants in the old book made him
sleepier and sleepier. Besides, he had the utmost
confidence in his arm-chair and, not realizing that
Ruggedo knew the length of time the magic chants
would take to run out, he felt sure the old gnome
would not try again to use his cloak. So he read on
and on and, while he was searching for the chant to
force a person to tell the truth, the book slipped from
his knees and a loud snore issued from his lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp54" id="i_236" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_236.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Wake up, Master! Wake up!” buzzed the clock,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
tilting forward in alarm.</p>

<p>“Wake up! Wake up!” scolded the arm-chair and
foot-stool both together. But before they could arouse
the wizard, Ruggedo had vanished. Four hours had
passed to the very minute, the magic of the wizard’s
chant had worn entirely away and at a whispered
command from the Gnome King, the magic cloak
had lifted him out of the imprisoning arms of
Wumbo’s chair and whirled him off and away. Over
mountains, hills and valleys flew the gnome in his
invisible cloak, through the chilly mists of early
morning till, far below, he saw the flashing spires
of the Emerald City of Oz.</p>

Kuma’s Hand Is At Work Again</h2>


<p>As the chair, foot-stool and clock lost their power
of speech at the same instant the Gnome King
regained his freedom, there was no one to arouse
Wumbo. And it was nearly noon time before he did
awaken. Puzzled to find himself in a chair instead
of bed he straightened up, gave himself a shake and
blinked sleepily up at the clock. Something about
the clock reminded him of his bad little visitor and,
whirling round, he stared anxiously at his arm-chair.
But of course Ruggedo was not there.</p>

<p>“Gone!” exclaimed the wizard, clapping his hand
to his head. “Wumbo, you’re growing old and stupid.
What’s to be done now? What’s to be done now?”</p>

<p>Shuffling anxiously up and down his crystal hearth,
Wumbo tried to think of the quickest way to locate
the wicked little gnome. A loud thump upon the door<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
interrupted his wonderings and, as he mechanically
muttered the magic phrase that opened it, the arm
and hand of Kuma Party came flying into the study.</p>

<p>“A message from my son,” breathed Wumbo,
hurrying forward to clasp the hand. There was a
note folded up in the palm and while the wizard
opened it the arm settled quietly down beside the
clock.</p>

<p>“Dear father,” wrote Kuma, “a small mortal boy
and a gnome came to my cottage yesterday afternoon.
The boy is lost and the gnome quite evidently
means mischief. Knowing the perils for a mortal
boy traveling in a magic country, I offered to lend
him my hand if he ever needed it. This morning he
sent for help and I have dispatched my right arm
and hand to help him escape from the Kingdom of
Patch and am sending my left to you for instructions.
Can you, by your magic, suggest a way to
locate the gnome and keep the boy from harm?</p>

<p>“Your dutiful and affectionate son Kuma.”</p>

<p>Pushing his specs high on his forehead and knocking
his wig sideways, Wumbo dashed over to his
desk, and wrote:</p>

<p>“Send your arm to the Emerald City. The gnome
has gone there wearing a cloak of invisibility. Take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
a letter of warning to Ozma and find and hold the
gnome till Ozma can by her magic overpower him.”</p>

<p>Folding the paper, he slipped it into Kuma’s hand.
The hand closed over it at once and in a flash the
arm swept out of the cave and away over the Gillikin
mountains.</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Wumbo, sinking into his chair,
which immediately gave him a reassuring little hug,
“that ought to help some. But the gnome certainly
means to make trouble!”</p>

<p>Wumbo had never mastered long-distance magic
and his spells and chants worked only when he was
present, but feeling that he had done all that he could
without breaking the law, and being fatigued by so
much thinking before breakfast, he gently clapped
his hands. In a flash an appetizing repast floated in
on a golden tray and settled upon his desk. Pulling
up his chair, Wumbo mumbled a few words over the
pens and pencils scattered about his desk. Next instant
they had rolled to the floor and straightened up
into an orchestra of five pieces. Softly and sweetly
they began to play an old Oz quadrille and, somewhat
soothed and comforted, the Wonder Worker began
eating his breakfast.</p>

Mystery In The Emerald City</h2>


<p>“Of course,” said Dorothy, leaning down to tie her
gold slipper, “of course, Ozma has only been
gone since yesterday, but even so, I think it would
be fun to have a party to welcome her home.”</p>

<p>“So do I! I love parties!” Clasping his knee with
his clumsy, stuffed hand, the Scarecrow smiled down
at the little girl. He had just walked over from his
corn-ear residence and they were sitting cozily in a
big swing on the front porch of the palace.</p>

<p>“Where did Ozma go?” asked the Scarecrow, taking
off his hat and smoothing back the few wisps of
straw that served him for hair.</p>

<p>“Just to spend the night with Glinda,” said Dorothy,
picking up a book of party games and beginning
to flip over the pages. “Ozma has her magic
belt with her and is going to wish herself back at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
three o’clock. Why, what are you laughing at?”
Putting down the book, Dorothy stared reproachfully
at her companion.</p>

<p>“I’m not laughing,” said the Scarecrow solemnly,
“but why pinch me that way? Of course, I have no
feeling, but it’s not very polite.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t pinch you at all,” exclaimed Dorothy, sitting
up very straight. The Scarecrow eyed the deep
dent in his stuffed arm, looked suspiciously all round
and then, seeing no one but Dorothy, moved quickly
to the opposite end of the swing.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” rumbled a deep voice and,
coming out from behind a gold pillar, the Cowardly
Lion paused before the royal swing. The Cowardly
Lion had come to the Emerald City with Dorothy on
her very first adventure and is the biggest pet in the
palace. He was a bit out of breath, for he had just
been running a race with his friend the Hungry
Tiger. “What’s the matter?” he panted anxiously,
for Dorothy was frowning crossly and the Scarecrow,
in spite of his painted smile, looked extremely sulky.</p>

<p>“While I was telling him about Ozma’s party, he
laughed at me,” pouted the little girl, moving as far
as she could from the straw man.</p>

<p>“But she pinched me,” explained the Scarecrow in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
an injured voice, “for no reason whatever!” It was
so unusual for these two—or for anyone in the Emerald
City—to quarrel, that the Cowardly Lion could
scarcely believe his lion ears and, when Dorothy began
to protest angrily that she had not pinched the
Scarecrow, he held up his paw pleadingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s talk about the party,” begged the lion
in a shocked roar. “What were you planning, my
dear?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Dorothy, flashing an angry glance at
the Scarecrow, “first I was going to have a speech
of welcome, then games and dancing and, after that,
Ozcream and—”</p>

<p>“Ouch!” coughed the lion, interrupting Dorothy
with an angry growl. “Who pulled my tail?” Rolling
his eyes from one to the other he rose to his feet,
trembling in every knee. “I’ve known you nearly all
my life,” roared the Cowardly Lion, shaking his
mane furiously, “but no one can pull my tail. Not
even you, Dorothy.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear! Oh dear! I think you’re both perfectly
horrid!” Throwing down her book, Dorothy jumped
out of the swing, and dashed around the side porch,
where she bumped violently into Sir Hokus, who was
taking his morning turn on the veranda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>“Odds daggers!” ejaculated the Knight, straightening
his shield and buckler. “What’s wrong,
maiden?”</p>

<p>“Everything!” wailed Dorothy, throwing her arms
round his neck. “Just because I’m trying to plan a
party everybody is fighting with me.”</p>

<p>“Fighting?” puffed Sir Hokus, brightening up at
the mere sound of the word, for he did dearly love
a battle. “Well, I’m on your side. Who dares to
fight with Princess Dot?” thundered the Knight in
his deep voice and, seizing her hand, stepped quickly
around the corner of the porch. But when he saw
the Cowardly Lion and the Scarecrow simply glaring
at one another, he paused in dismay. They were his
oldest friends and never, since his arrival in the
Emerald City, had he had a disagreement with either
of them. Feeling that there must be some mistake,
he strode hastily between the two celebrities and held
up his hand. As he did, he received a staggering
blow on the head that pushed his helmet well down
over his ears.</p>

<p>“Odds dragons and flagons!” blustered the Knight,
sputtering like a red hot coal. “Have at you, villains!
Varlets! Rascals and rogues!” Drawing his
sword, he began slashing in every direction, but as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
his helmet was over his eyes, he fortunately did
no harm.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_247" style="max-width: 66.125em;">

</figure>

<p>Crouching behind the swing, Ruggedo, in his invisible
cloak, rocked to and fro with silent merriment,
holding his sides and shaking all over with
malicious glee. Arriving at the palace early that
morning, the Gnome King had immediately ordered
the cloak to carry him to the royal apartment. But
Ozma, to his great disgust and disappointment, was
not there. Neither was his belt, nor any of the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
Queen’s magic appliances, for she had taken them all
with her to Glinda’s castle. Until he had the belt,
Ruggedo was perfectly powerless and, after his first
disappointment had worn off, he determined to wait
for Ozma’s return, seize the belt as soon as she appeared
and at once destroy the Emerald City and all
of its inhabitants.</p>

<p>While he waited, Ruggedo had run here and there
about the palace, amusing himself in his own spiteful
fashion. Now that he had learned from Dorothy
the exact time of Ozma’s return, he fluttered off to
the kitchen to steal some breakfast and plague the
cook. Meanwhile Sir Hokus had tripped over a flower
pot and fallen flat, while the Cowardly Lion and the
Scarecrow had retreated behind two porch pillars.
Dorothy, terribly alarmed at the serious turn the
quarrel had taken, rushed hurriedly forward. Now
that Ruggedo had gone, the whole thing seemed silly
and ridiculous.</p>

<p>“Let’s make up,” begged Dorothy, helping Sir
Hokus to his feet. “I’m sure it’s all a mistake.”</p>

<p>“Well, it was a great mistake to pull my tail,”
rumbled the Cowardly Lion, coming out very slowly
and majestically, “but I’ll overlook it this once.” He
blinked suspiciously at the Scarecrow, but the Scarecrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
was helping Sir Hokus with his helmet and did
not even notice.</p>

<p>“Who thumpst me again—” panted the Knight,
pointing his fore finger furiously downward—“who
thumpst me again—d—dies!”</p>

<p>“But nobody will!” Dorothy hastened to assure
him. She looked pleadingly at the Scarecrow, who
she felt must be responsible. “Let’s forget all about
it and think about the party,” she proposed brightly.
“Now, who’ll make the speech of welcome?”</p>

<p>“Let Scraps do it,” muttered the Cowardly Lion,
licking his paws sulkily. “She’s clever at speeches
and makes short ones, too. I’ll go find her,” he offered
in a little more cheerful voice. “Haven’t seen
her since yesterday, but I s’pose she’s around somewhere.”</p>

<p>“All right,” smiled Dorothy, as the Cowardly Lion
thudded across the porch. “Now, who’ll help me
decorate the banquet hall?” Sir Hokus had taken off
his helmet and was rubbing his head wrathfully. At
Dorothy’s words he glanced across at the Scarecrow,
but the straw man’s painted eyes met his so frankly
and innocently that he impulsively put out his hand.
Certainly the Scarecrow’s flimsy arm could never
have dealt him such a blow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll help you,” said the Knight, taking the
Scarecrow’s arm. “’Twas that villain lion who
thumped me,” he whispered as they started for the
banquet hall.</p>

<p>“Here come Betsy and Trot,” cried Dorothy, forgetting
all about the quarrel. “Maybe they will pick
some flowers for the table!”</p>

<p>Betsy and Trot, as many of you already know, are
two little mortals like Dorothy, who have been invited
by Ozma to live in the royal palace. Both
reached Oz after ship-wrecks and many trying adventures
and they found life in the capital so exciting
and gay that they have never wished to return to the
United States. They were delighted at the prospect
of a party, and so was the Hungry Tiger, who had
come up just behind them. Putting a huge flower
basket on his back, the two little girls ran gaily down
the palace steps.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a strawberry sandwich,” purred the
tiger, looking over his shoulder at Dorothy. “Be
sure to have strawberry sandwiches!”</p>

<p>“I never heard of a strawberry sandwich,” laughed
the little girl, shaking her head dubiously.</p>

<p>“Well, there always has to be a first,” chuckled
the tiger, trotting after Betsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>Dorothy, looking a little puzzled, waved after him
and, well pleased with her plans, ran into the castle
to ask the Wizard of Oz to think up some new tricks
to entertain the guests, and to confer with the cook
about refreshments. Soon the palace began to hum
with activity. The banquet hall, under the skillful
hands of the Scarecrow and Sir Hokus took on a
truly festive air. Messengers and pages ran hither
and thither with invitations, while the Royal band,
tuning up on the castle lawn, added its strains to
the general gaiety. Indeed, from the preparations for
her return, one would have thought Ozma had been
gone a year instead of a day, and Ruggedo, fluttering
here and there in his invisible robe, chuckled with
amusement and malice.</p>

<p>“Work away,” muttered the Gnome King darkly.
“At three o’clock I shall send you all to the bottom of
the Nonestic Ocean, transport my gnomes here and
enjoy this party my own self.” At first, Ruggedo
had continued his pinching and punching and hair
pullings but, at last, fearing detection, he had
stopped his mischievous teasing and seated himself
calmly in Ozma’s chair at the head of the banquet
table. In this position it would be a simple matter
to unclasp his magic belt as soon as the little fairy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
made ready to take her place. The patch, which was
the only visible thing about Ruggedo, was now on
the seat of the chair, so did not show and, quite unconscious
of their dreadful peril, Dorothy and her
friends went on with their preparations for the party,
while Ruggedo, fidgeting with impatience, kept his
eyes fastened upon the emerald clock.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes of three! Twenty minutes, and
then—! The little gnome fairly hugged himself
with wicked anticipation. Ten minutes of three and
now everything was in readiness. Dorothy and Betsy,
giggling together, were putting the finishing touches
to the table. The Scarecrow and Sir Hokus, between
them, were composing a speech of welcome, for, of
course, the Cowardly Lion had not been able to find
the Patchwork Girl. Ranged about the walls in pleasant
anticipation stood the courtiers and dear old
celebrities of Oz. Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman,
summoned from his palace by the Wizard’s magic,
stood conversing in a low tone with Pastoria, Ozma’s
Royal Father, about his crop of tin cans, which were
larger this year than ever before. The little Wizard
of Oz, himself, was whispering to Tik Tok, the machine
man, some of the tricks he was planning for
the company’s amusement and the metal man was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
chuckling with mechanical mirth. Hank, Betsy’s
mule, Toto, Dorothy’s little dog, the Saw Horse,
Ozma’s Royal Steed, and all of the other palace pets
were sitting expectantly at their own special table.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_253" style="max-width: 63.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_253.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Now then!” exclaimed the Scarecrow, having finished
the speech of welcome to his own and the
Knight’s satisfaction, “as soon as I have finished this
address, I shall extend a hand of welcome to our little ruler,
lead her triumphantly to the head of the
table and—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“Look!” rasped the Tin Woodman, who stood nearest
the door. “Look! Look up! Look out!” Following
the direction of Nick Chopper’s tin finger
everyone did look and, next minute, in fright and
bewilderment, huddled together for protection, for
over their heads flashed the hand of Kuma Party.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_254" style="max-width: 58.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_254.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“The welcoming hand!” gasped the Scarecrow,
clutching Sir Hokus. “But whose? Everybody count
his hands,” mumbled the Scarecrow, looking anxiously
at his own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp65" id="i_255" style="max-width: 50em;">

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“The hand that smote me,” roared the Knight,
making a lunge at the hand with his sword. Everyone
else ducked, dodged and shuddered as the arm
sailed hither and thither over their heads.</p>

<p>“It’s a trick of the Wizard’s,” faltered Dorothy,
looking hopefully at the little man. But the Wizard,
peering palely from behind a huge green chair, shook
his head positively.</p>

<p>“I had no hand in this,” muttered the Wizard,
mopping his bald head with his best hanky. Now,
Kuma’s hand could unfortunately carry out only the
instructions given it by its owner. The note of warning
for Ozma was tightly clasped in its fingers, but
as Ozma was not present, it presumed she was to be
found in another part of the palace and immediately
flashed up the golden stairway in search of her
and the invisible gnome. But Ruggedo was now
more invisible than ever, having crawled under the
table at the first sight of the flying arm. As the arm
disappeared, everyone heaved a high of relief.</p>

<p>“Come! Come!” wheezed the Wizard, stepping out
nervously from behind the green chair, “we must not
let a little thing like this spoil the party.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s three o’clock now!”</p>

<p>“And here’s Ozma!” cried Dorothy. And there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
indeed, was Ozma, standing with a quiet smile in the
doorway. At once the Scarecrow burst into his speech:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">“Welcome Ozma, beauteous Queen</div>

  </div>
</div>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_257.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

<p>Thump! Ban—g! CRASH! With hand still upraised,
the Scarecrow swung to the long French windows.
So did everyone for that matter.</p>

<p>“A menagerie!” shrilled Nick Chopper, falling
back against the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>“Why, it’s Scraps!” burst out the Scarecrow, as
the oztrich, with his three dusty riders, plunged giddily
into the room.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_258" style="max-width: 63.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_258.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Beware!” roared the oztrich in a terrible voice,
and when an oztrich roars it is four times louder than
a lion. “Beware!”</p>

<p>Knocking over Tik Tok and three footmen, bearing
trays of lemonade, the great green bird rushed impetuously
toward the queen. “Beware!” it roared
again so lustily that Ozma’s curls blew straight out
behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>“Beware,” coughed the Scarecrow irritably. “Well,
I ought to be where you are. Out of my place, you
rude monster.”</p>

<p>“Beware the Gnome King!” finished the oztrich,
bowing his head so low and so suddenly that the
Patchwork Girl fell off one side and Peter and
Grumpy off the other.</p>

The Theft Of The Magic Belt</h2>


<p>Ozma, surprised enough at the party, was so
startled and dismayed by the oztrich’s roars
that she caught at a little gold stand to keep from
falling. As she steadied herself, two arms clasped
themselves round her waist.</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Someone is trying to steal my magic
belt!” wailed the little fairy, swaying dizzily from
side to side.</p>

<p>“Take this! Take this!” Bounding to his feet,
Peter picked up the oztrich egg and fairly forced it
into Ozma’s arms. As he did so there came a blood-curdling
screech, and then, perfect silence.</p>

<p>“It’s Ruggedo!” puffed the Patchwork Girl, who
had picked herself up by this time.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_262" style="max-width: 61em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_262.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Look for a blue patch! Look for a blue patch!”
panted Grumpy, standing on his hind legs and sniffing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
the air anxiously. But there was no sign of a
blue patch anywhere, for Ruggedo at the first glimpse
of the egg had commanded the magic cloak to carry
him to the royal stable. Here, trembling and shaken,
he cowered in the Hungry Tiger’s stall. Furious to
have been frustrated by Peter at the very instant
when success seemed sure, he raved and sputtered
and tried to think up some way to get his belt in
spite of the hateful egg. Meanwhile, in the palace,
the utmost confusion prevailed, and when the hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
of Kuma again flashed into the banquet hall and
flew like an arrow to Ozma and dropped the note of
warning into her lap, the courtiers fled in every direction,
while the celebrities crowded close about the
little Queen to protect her from these confusing and
invisible enemies.</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop!” panted Peter, as Sir Hokus, waving
his sword, made determined swings at the flying
arm. “It’s a helping hand! It belongs to a friend
of mine, Sir!” Tugging at the iron coat tails of the
Knight, he sought to dissuade him from his grim
purpose, but not until Ozma clapped sharply did the
good Knight desist.</p>

<p>Leaning back wearily in the chair to which the
Scarecrow had guided her, and still holding the great
oztrich egg in her lap, Ozma turned to Scraps.</p>

<p>“What does this mean? Who are these strangers,
and where is the Gnome King?” asked Ozma in a
faint voice. As she spoke, Kuma’s hand patted Peter
approvingly on the head, doubled into a fist under
the Knight’s nose and, sailing upward, settled quietly
on the green chandelier.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I’ve been a Queen, I’ve riz and fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And have a thrilling tale to tell!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>puffed Scraps, tossing back her yarn dramatically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind the thrills, come to the point! Come
to the point!” growled the Cowardly Lion, looking
uneasily at the oztrich, who was strutting pompously
up and down the banquet hall, and at Grumpy, who
was casting longing eyes at the banquet table.</p>

<p>Now the whole company turned expectantly to the
Patchwork Girl and, enjoying the importance of her
position and news to the very fullest extent, Scraps
told her story and Peter’s, while the little boy kept a
sharp lookout for the invisible gnome. Scraps’ own
adventures were surprising enough, but when she
came to Peter’s experiences with the former Gnome
King, the sea quakes, their escape in the pirate ship
and the magic casket of Soob, the Sorcerer, the excitement
of her hearers knew no bounds. Clapping
on two pair of specs, the Wizard of Oz rushed from
the room to fetch his encyclopedia of magic and his
black bag, for he felt that his utmost skill would be
needed to prevent the gnome from carrying out his
wicked plans.</p>

<p>“It must have been Ruggedo who pinched you and
pulled the Cowardly Lion’s tail,” whispered Dorothy,
who was standing between Sir Hokus and the Scarecrow.
When the good Knight heard how Kuma had
dispatched his hand to aid Peter and Scraps in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
escape from Patch, he waved apologetically at the
arm resting on the chandelier. It at once descended
and began shaking hands all around and Peter, staring
at that gay and brilliant assemblage, thought he
had never seen so interesting and strange a sight.
The Hungry Tiger, now that the story was told, was
all for going on with the party, but the Wizard,
realizing the extreme danger they were in, said no.</p>

<p>“Put all the magic treasures together and place
the oztrich egg on top of them,” commanded the
wizard, “for Ruggedo dare not touch them so long as
the egg is near.”</p>

<p>So Ozma unclasped her belt and, placing the oztrich
egg in the center, put her magic box and wishing
pills beside it.</p>

<p>“I cannot believe Ruggedo would be so wicked,”
sighed Ozma, turning sadly to the Scarecrow. “Now
that he sees it is impossible to steal the belt perhaps
he will go away.”</p>

<p>“Not he!” answered the Scarecrow positively.
“He’s around here somewhere, depend on that, and
until we find him, watch out!”</p>

<p>“Why not eat, while we watch?” purred the Hungry
Tiger. “These travellers look tired and hungry
and deserve refreshment after their long journey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>Grumpy rolled his eyes approvingly at the Hungry
Tiger and Ozma, in spite of herself, had to smile.
As she nodded her royal head, the Scarecrow burst
into his speech of welcome all over again, the footmen
began pulling out the chairs and everyone settled
down as if nothing at all had happened. Grumpy
had a place between the Hungry Tiger and Cowardly
Lion, and they, well pleased with the behavior of the
little bear, did their best to make him feel at home.
The oztrich stood up behind Grumpy, swallowing rapidly
everything that came within reach. Scraps had
the seat of honor beside Ozma, and Peter, between
Dorothy and Sir Hokus, was plied with every delicacy.
The hand of Kuma, trained to serve, flew backward
and forward, filling tumblers, carrying trays and
generally making itself useful.</p>

<p>“Dost like our Emerald City, lad?” queried Sir
Hokus, bending kindly toward the little boy.</p>

<p>“Well,” acknowledged Peter quite truthfully, “I
haven’t seen much of it, the oztrich ran so fast, you
know.”</p>

<p>“A rare and exceptional bird!” murmured Sir
Hokus mildly, “but not my idea of a giddy steed.”</p>

<p>“Nor mine!” whispered Peter, winking sociably at
the Knight. “He goes twenty feet at one jump and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
travels like a hurricane.” Between bites, Peter told
the Knight how they had run over the bookman and
a little more about the pirate ship and the Sultan of
Suds, while Scraps, at the head of the table, gave a
spirited account of her experiences as Queen of the
Quilties.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_267" style="max-width: 96.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_267.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>So light hearted and gay are these dear people of
Oz that soon they were laughing and chatting as
merrily as if no danger threatened their little ruler
or themselves. Only the Wizard seemed to be bothering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
about the Gnome King. He had placed his encyclopedia
beside him on the table and, nibbling absently
at a chicken leg, continued to pore over its
finely printed pages in an effort to trace the magic
articles Peter had found in the sorcerer’s chest. It
must be confessed that Peter glanced from time to
time at the chair where the magic belt lay, marveling
at its wonderful powers and hoping that when everything
was over it would safely transport him back to
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>“After the party we’ll have the Cowardly Lion
take us all over the Emerald City,” promised Dorothy,
as Peter dipped his spoon into a heaping saucer
of Ozcream. Blissfully, Peter nodded, then glancing
again at the magic belt, dropped his spoon with a
crash and pushed back his chair.</p>

<p>“The egg!” gasped Peter wildly. “It’s hatched!”
And it most certainly had! As the startled company
sprang to their feet, the baby oztrich stepped awkwardly
out of its shell, wabbled to the edge of the
chair and fell off. And that was not all! For as the
oztrich, with great strides, rushed to the side of its
child, the magic belt, the box of wishing pills and the
magic box disappeared and a blue patch began to
flutter and dance before the horrified eyes of the now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
thoroughly alarmed guests of Ozma.</p>

<p>“The Gnome King!” groaned the Wizard, slamming
his book with a bang.</p>

<p>“The belt!” screamed Peter, dashing toward the
blue patch. Feeling that something might happen
that would enable him to carry out his plans, Ruggedo
had returned to the banquet hall and, watching
from a safe distance, saw to his utter relief and astonishment
that the egg had hatched. Instantly its
power over him ceased and, dashing forward, he had
pounced upon the belt and clasped it about his waist.</p>

<p>“Revenge!” roared the voice of the invisible gnome.
“Revenge! Next moment I shall send you all to the
bottom of the Nonestic Ocean!”</p>

<p>“Not that! Not that!” faltered the Patchwork
Girl, clutching Ozma in a panic. “I never could stand
water!”</p>

The Wizard Makes The Gnome King Visible</h2>


<p>At Ruggedo’s words, the celebrities and courtiers
clung shuddering together. Knowing the awful
power of the belt and feeling that they were indeed
lost, they waited for the Gnome King to speak. But
Peter, seizing first a tumbler, then a plate, sent them
flying at the blue patch. Ruggedo might be invisible,
but he was still there. Shaking his head angrily as
the tumbler broke over his crown he cried in a loud
voice, “I command you to transport—”</p>

<p>The plate, crashing against his nose, made him
pause, and Peter followed this with a vase and water
pitcher. But gnomes have hard heads and, with an
angry roar, Ruggedo began again, “I command you
to transport these people—”</p>

<p>By this time Peter had thrown everything in reach.
Feeling desperately in his pocket he sent a top, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
baseball and a box of fish hooks whizzing through the
air. Then, as his fingers closed on the sorcerer’s
stone, he flung that, too, at the invisible gnome. Instantly
there was a complete and utter silence. The
patch still fluttered wildly before their eyes and, as
the stunned company eyed it in horrified suspense,
the hand of Kuma descended and closed roughly on
the invisible shoulder of Ruggedo.</p>

<p>“Hold him! Hold him!” panted the Wizard, rushing
forward with his black bag. “I remember now
the magic to make him visible.” The little Wizard
of Oz seldom uses chants and, instead of the verse
Wumbo had employed, sprinkled a black and white
powder over the Gnome King. Even years afterward
Peter could remember the distorted and furious face
of Ruggedo, as the spell of the magic cloak was
broken and he stood revealed to his enemies. Struggling
to shake off the clutch of Kuma’s hand, he was
desperately trying to speak to the magic belt. But,
though his mouth moved, not a sound issued from his
lips.</p>

<p>“Struck dumb!” cried the Scarecrow, unclasping
his arms from the Knight’s neck, where he had flung
them in his extreme agitation. “But how! And
why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>“I have it! I have it!” exclaimed the Wizard,
pouncing upon the emerald that Peter, as a last
resort, had hurled at the Gnome King. “This is the
famous Silence Stone, used by the ancient Emperors
of Oz to keep their wives quiet in times of war. How
it came into the possession of Soob I cannot imagine,
but see, here written in magic on the emerald itself
is the whole story: ‘Whom this stone touches on the
head shall remain silent for seven years’.”</p>

<p>“Yon honest lad hath saved the realm!” boomed
Sir Hokus, slapping Peter on the back and beaming
joyfully upon the still trembling company.</p>

<p>“I wish I could have read that before,” puffed
Peter.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s lucky you threw it when you did,” answered
the Wizard. “One more word and we’d have
been at the bottom of the sea. As it is—” Calmly
the wizard unclasped the belt from the scowling
Gnome King and, snatching the box of mixed magic
and the wishing pills, handed them back to Ozma—“As
it is, Ruggedo is perfectly harmless.”</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Peter!” cried the Scarecrow,
waving his hat over his head. “His aim and arm
have saved the day.”</p>

<p>“That’s because he’s such a good pitcher,” mumbled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
the little bear, and the cheers were given with
such a will all the dishes on the table skipped. Ozwold,
who had buried his head in a flower pot at the
first of the Gnome King’s threats, now reared it cautiously
and, with mud still sticking to his bill, approached
the Queen.</p>

<p>“If Your Highness will excuse me,” quavered the
oztrich hoarsely, “I must be going. This excitement
is very bad for my child.”</p>

<p>Plucking a plume from his tail, Ozwold extended it
politely. Smiling kindly, Ozma took the plume and
sent Jellia, her little maid, to fetch an emerald necklace,
for Scraps had, just in time, reminded her of the
hatchday present for the baby oztrich.</p>

<p>“This is simply magnif—!” murmured Ozwold and,
as Ozma fastened the necklace round his long neck,
the company cheered and cheered again, for they felt
that the great green bird was in a large measure responsible
for their safety. Ozwold, himself, was anxious
to turn his child over to his wife and tell her the
story of his amazing adventures, so Dorothy and
Peter placed the baby oztrich on his back, fastening
it securely with a hair ribbon. Nodding stiffly to
the right and left, Ozwold strutted proudly from the
banquet hall, and immediately the Ozites surrounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
Peter, congratulating and praising him, till the little
boy grew quite red with embarrassment and pleasure.</p>

<p>At Ozma’s command, Ruggedo was led away to the
cellar and, with nothing more to worry them or mar
the festivities, the party began again and lasted far
into the night. The Emerald Palace is so large and
so roomy that none of the guests thought of going
home and, after the Wizard had performed the last
of his tricks and Scraps had recited the funniest of
her verses, they all trooped off to bed, calling cheerily
to each other as they mounted the golden stairs.
Peter had a royal suite to himself and, curling down
luxuriously in the grand gold bed, wondered if he
were not already asleep and dreaming of all this magnificence.
A bare little room had been found for
Grumpy, and the little bear, well pleased with his new
quarters and comrades, was soon asleep and snoring
tremendously.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_20">CHAPTER 20<br>
Peter Is Made A Prince Of Oz</h2>


<p>With Scraps and Dorothy for guides and the Cowardly
Lion and Hungry Tiger for steeds, Peter
and Grumpy rode over the whole Emerald City next
morning, receiving everywhere the cheers and acclaim
of the inhabitants. The story of Peter’s
prowess had gone abroad and he was everywhere
hailed as the hero of the hour. Right after breakfast,
he had written a long note to Kuma, telling him
the whole story of Ruggedo’s treachery and thanking
him for his great generosity. Kuma’s arm, which
had needed for the night only a little elbow room,
immediately flew back to its master, with the note
and a great bag of emeralds sent by Ozma to express
her thanks and appreciation.</p>

<p>Luncheon was another party, but, as Dorothy and
Betsy explained to the little boy, every day in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
Emerald City is just like one big party.</p>

<p>“Do stay here!” urged Dorothy and, Ozma herself,
coming to Peter’s chair, begged him to make his
home in the marvelous land of Oz.</p>

<p>“You shall be a Prince!” promised Ozma graciously,
“and rule over one of our smaller Kingdoms.
Prince Peter the First, how is that?” The celebrities
waved and cheered at Ozma’s words, and Peter, seeing
that everyone expected it, rose to make the most
important speech of his life.</p>

<p>“I’d like to stay and be a Prince,” said Peter slowly,
“but you see, folks, I’m a pitcher and I couldn’t go
back on the fellows and on my grandfather, so if your
Majesty will just transport me to Philadelphia, why
that will be reward enough.”</p>

<p>“Spoken like a true and loyal Knight!” cried Sir
Hokus, thumping on the table.</p>

<p>“Good-night!” sighed Scraps, for she had taken a
great fancy to Peter, and had rather hoped he would
stay in Oz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowp54" id="i_279" style="max-width: 51.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_279.png" alt="">
</figure>

<p>“Would you like to go now?” asked Ozma, with a
merry smile, for Ozma had a little plan of her own.
Peter nodded a little bashfully, for it did seem a bit
rude to want to leave so delightful a place and company,
but he felt that he ought to get in a little practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
for the game. So Ozma immediately put on her
magic belt and, extending her right hand, said, imperiously:</p>

<p>“I command you to transport this boy and the
pirate’s gold to Philadelphia!” Instantly Peter vanished
and the Ozites, running up the stairs two at a
time, crowded round the magic picture in Ozma’s sitting
room.</p>

<p>“Show us Peter,” panted Ozma, for she was a little
out of breath from her run. At her words the country
scene in the picture faded and there <i>was</i> Peter,
sitting in the middle of a dusty ball field, with a bag
of gold on each side, and a crowd of cheering boys
around him.</p>

<p>“I thought some of that gold might be real!” exclaimed
Ozma, turning triumphantly to the Wizard.
“Polacky must have been a real pirate before he
sailed into the Nonestic Ocean and while I could not
transport any of our gold or jewels to Philadelphia,
two bags of the pirate’s gold were real.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Won’t he have fun!” squealed Dorothy, giving
Scraps a hug.</p>

<p>That night Peter, sitting on the arm of his grandfather’s
chair, had the pleasure of seeing in the evening
paper the heading he had thought up himself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>“Philadelphia Boy Finds Treasure and Saves the
Emerald City of Oz.”</p>

<p>Back in the Capital there were only a few things to
settle now. The Silence Stone and Magic Cloak were
carefully stored away in the emerald safe in the
Wizard’s laboratory to be used in case of extreme
danger or war.</p>

<p>Kaliko was at once notified of Ruggedo’s capture
and permitted to resume his place as King of the
Gnomes.</p>

<p>Walking in the garden, the same afternoon that
Peter had been sent back to Philadelphia, the Wizard
of Oz had noticed a gold thread running under one
of the benches. Following it curiously he found that
it led into the palace, up the stairs to the very top
sunny chamber where an old Winkie Woman named
Susan Smiggs did all the palace mending. Susan,
then, was the proper ruler of Patch, and Scraps, shaking
her head dubiously, watched the fat little seamstress
drive away in the Red Wagon, to take up her
duties as Queen of the Quilties. But as Ozma had
promised to revise the laws of Patch, perhaps Susan
will have a better time than the Patchwork Girl did.</p>

<p>As for Ruggedo, deciding that the loss of speech
for seven years was punishment enough, Ozma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
kindly granted the gnome his freedom, first taking
the precaution to have him dipped into the fountain
of Oblivion. As anyone touched by these waters forgets
all his past wickedness, let us hope that from
now on Ruggedo will lead a better life and cause no
more trouble in Oz.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
